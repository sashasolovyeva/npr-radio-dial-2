    "title": "U.N. climate talks end without agreement on phasing out fossil fuels",
    "text": "This year's United Nations global climate conference in Brazil ended on Saturday with a formal agreement that failed to address phasing out fossil fuels — the main driver of global warming. The United States was conspicuously absent from this year's talks, known as COP30, after the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/10/nx-s1-5601876/trump-cop30-climate-brazil-belem\" target=\"_blank\"><u>refused</u></a> to send a delegation to Belém, Brazil. In the end, the conference delivered only modest progress on international efforts to curb global warming and pay for the costs of adapting to a hotter planet. Earlier in the week, more than 80 countries had demanded negotiators agree to a \"roadmap\" to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels. The group included many developing nations hit hard by climate change, along with the United Kingdom, Germany, and oil producers like Mexico and Brazil.  They said world leaders need to start drawing up concrete plans to deliver on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/12/13/1218125835/climate-talks-end-on-a-first-ever-call-for-the-world-to-move-away-from-fossil-fu\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a landmark 2023 commitment</u></a> to reduce the use of oil, coal and natural gas. However, major fossil-fuel producers including Russia and Saudi Arabia have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-cop30-c2c66ea017db8984102702320142ce76\" target=\"_blank\"><u>opposed</u></a> the creation of a process or timetable to move away from those energy resources. In the end, the formal agreement did not include any mention of fossil fuels.  The president of this year's summit, André Aranha Corrêa do Lago of Brazil, acknowledged that many countries had wanted a more ambitious agreement. Two dozen countries have said they'll work alongside the U.N. in a new process focused on  transitioning away from fossil fuels.  In April, Colombia and the Netherlands <a href=\"https://fossilfueltreaty.org/first-international-conference\" target=\"_blank\"><u>plan to host</u></a> the first international conference focused on the issue. Ralph Regenvanu is climate change minister of Vanuatu, an island nation facing rising sea levels. He says the new conference is the key accomplishment to emerge in Belém. \"The text is not great, but at least we have an outcome,\" Regenvanu says. Here are the important take-aways from COP30. <h3>No roadmap for fossil-fuel transition</h3> The burning of fossil fuels remains the biggest driver of global warming. However, climate negotiators have struggled for years to agree on how countries should address the world's reliance on those resources. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/12/13/1218125835/climate-talks-end-on-a-first-ever-call-for-the-world-to-move-away-from-fossil-fu\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Two years ago in Dubai</u></a>, countries for the first time called for a global transition away from fossil fuels. This year, dozens of countries had wanted world leaders to start coming up with plans to do just that. But in the end, there was no such deal. The final agreement in Brazil says countries understand the \"need for urgent action\" to make \"deep, rapid and sustained\" cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, without any specific mention of fossil fuels. Many countries were disappointed. \"There is no [climate change] mitigation if we cannot discuss transitioning away from fossil fuels,\" said Daniela Durán González, head of international affairs for the Colombian Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. Setting a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels won't be easy. The global economy still largely runs on oil, coal and natural gas, though countries are adding huge amounts of renewable energy to their electric grids. A transition away from fossil fuels should not be imposed on countries, especially developing nations, Nigeria's delegate told the conference.  Nigeria will not support climate plans \"that will lead to our sudden economic contraction and heightened social instability,\" the delegate said. <h3>The planet will pass a critical temperature limit in the 2030s</h3> COP30 came as a crucial temperature target slipped out of reach. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations agreed to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to temperatures in the late 1800s. Scientists have found that risks to people and ecosystems <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5593087/climate-tipping-points-cop30-brazil-coral-glaciers-carbon\" target=\"_blank\"><u>accelerate</u></a> with every tenth of a degree beyond that limit.  But a <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/48854;jsessionid=ACE1B56D68DB246540380BAF371300D3\" target=\"_blank\">recent United Nations report</a> concluded that the planet will likely exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming in the next decade. It is still possible to limit that overshoot, however. If countries can cut overall greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035, scientists say the planet would quickly return to lower levels of warming. The world is not currently on track to meet that goal. Under current policies, global emissions are expected to fall by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5593050/climate-emissions-gap-cop30\" target=\"_blank\"><u>just 12% by 2035</u></a>. That's not nearly enough to avoid catastrophic warming, according to science from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \"The science says we need five times that much,\" says Alden Meyer, a senior associate at E3G, a climate change think tank. \"We need a 60% reduction if we have any chance of staying close to the 1.5 Celsius temperature goal.\" <h3>Little progress on funding climate action</h3> With the world facing worsening impacts from climate change, attention has increasingly focused on ways to help nations adapt. That means money. The challenge is especially urgent in poorer countries, which typically suffer some of the worst impacts from disasters, yet bear little responsibility for the pollution that's raising global temperatures. At last year's climate summit in Azerbaijan, wealthy countries <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/23/nx-s1-5202805/cop29-climate-change-un-azerbaijan\" target=\"_blank\"><u>agreed to a deal</u></a> to provide developing nations with at least $300 billion a year in financing by 2035. That's triple what poorer countries were promised under <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/05/developed-countries-materially-surpassed-their-usd-100-billion-climate-finance-commitment-in-2022-oecd.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a previous commitment</u></a>. The deal struck in Azerbaijan also included a broader target to boost overall climate financing for developing countries — including from the private sector — to $1.3 trillion annually within a decade. But wealthy countries have been unreliable funders in the past. Developed nations were late meeting a prior funding commitment. And funds set up to compensate countries for climate-related damages are still mostly empty, according to U.N. Secretary General António Guterres. Meanwhile, developing nations face growing losses from extreme weather events. Weeks ago, for example, <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-enhanced-intensity-of-hurricane-melissa-testing-limits-of-adaptation-in-jamaica-and-eastern-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Hurricane Melissa</u></a> hit Jamaica as a category 5 storm, causing an estimated $10 billion in damage – equal to nearly a third of the country's gross domestic product, according to Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's minister of economic growth and job creation. The negotiations in Brazil did little clarify how additional funding will be provided. The final agreement \"calls for efforts\" to triple within a decade the amount of financing available to help nations adapt to a hotter world, like better flood defenses and infrastructure that's built for more extreme weather. The deal also says countries agreed to \"urgently advance actions\" to boost climate financing for developing countries. <h3>China spotlighted trade issues</h3> With the U.S. absent from this year's talks, attention turned to China, which is both the largest current source of climate pollution, and the global leader in manufacturing green technology like solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles. China has elevated discussions of trade at the conference, says Li Shuo, director of the China hub at the nonprofit Asia Society. \"They happen to be the country that produces the lion's share of green and low-carbon products. And they have become now a champion of free trade in this particular regard,\" he says. \"They want the rest of the world to purchase their products.\" <h3>A new conference for phasing out fossil fuels</h3> One of the key events at the conference was the announcement of a new conference dedicated to the global phase-out of fossil fuels. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5582812/climate-colombia-fossil-fuels-renewable-energy-cop30\" target=\"_blank\"><u>The conference will be held in Colombia, a fossil fuel producer</u></a>, and co-hosted by the Netherlands - the birthplace of oil giant Shell. Colombia's Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres told NPR that the new conference held in Santa Marta, Colombia, will be complementary to the U.N. climate process. \"The idea of the Santa Marta conference is to have this first space in which we are completely clear that the phasing out [of fossil fuels] is necessary,\" Torres says. Meyer says he isn't surprised that this new conference has emerged. \" I think it reflects the frustration of both countries and NGOs who have seen very little action in this [United Nations] process,\" Meyer says.<br>",

    "title": "More than 300 children were abducted in an attack on a Catholic school in Nigeria",
    "text": "ABUJA, Nigeria — A total of 303 schoolchildren and 12 teachers were abducted by gunmen during an attack on St. Mary's School, a Catholic institution in north-central Nigeria's Niger state, the Christian Association of Nigeria said Saturday, updating an earlier tally of 215 schoolchildren. The tally was changed \"after a verification exercise and a final census was carried out,\" according to a statement issued by the Most. Rev. Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, chairman of the Niger state chapter of CAN, who visited the school on Friday. He said 88 other students \"were also captured after they tried to escape\" during the attack. The students were both male and female and ranged in age from 10 to 18. The school kidnapping in Niger state's remote Papiri community happened four days after 25 schoolchildren were seized in similar circumstances in neighboring Kebbi state's Maga town, which is 170 kilometers (106 miles) away. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the abductions and authorities have said tactical squads have been deployed alongside local hunters to rescue the children. Yohanna described as false a claim from the state government that the school had reopened for studies despite an earlier directive for schools in that part of Niger state to close temporarily due to security threats. \"We did not receive any circular. It must be an afterthought and a way to shift blame,\" he said, calling on families \"to remain calm and prayerful.\" School kidnappings have come to define insecurity in Africa's most populous nation, and armed gangs often see schools as \"strategic\" targets to draw more attention. UNICEF said last year that only 37% of schools across 10 of the conflict-hit states have early warning systems to detect threats. Niger state has now shut down all schools as a measure to forestall other kidnappings. The decision was in a bid to protect lives and property, Niger Gov. Umar Bago told reporters Saturday after meeting with security officials in Minna. \"It is the decision of stakeholders today to close all schools in Niger state. All schools are closed till further notice. So we have declared Christmas holiday for all schools in Niger state,\" Bago said. The kidnappings are happening amid U.S. President Donald Trump's claims of targeted killings against Christians in the West African country. Attacks in Nigeria affect both Christians and Muslims. The school attack earlier this week in Kebbi state was in a Muslim-majority town. The attack also took place as Nigerian National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu was visiting the U.S. where he met Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday.",

    "title": "Brazil's Bolsonaro arrested for allegedly plotting escape ahead of prison term",
    "text": "SAO PAULO — Brazil's federal police on Saturday arrested former president Jair Bolsonaro over suspicion he was plotting to escape and avoid starting a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5535658/bolsonaro-brazil-coup-trial\" target=\"_blank\">27-year prison sentence</a> for leading a coup attempt. In a dramatic and unexpected twist in the final stage of a long and divisive criminal trial, federal agents entered Bolsonaro's house early Saturday under the order of a Supreme Court Justice to take the former president to the headquarters of the country's federal police in the capital, Brasilia. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case on Bolsonaro's attempt to keep the presidency after his defeat to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2022, ordered the preemptive arrest after saying the far-right leader's ankle monitor was violated at 12:08 a.m. on Saturday. His lawyers claimed in a statement that did not take place. Bolsonaro, 70, who had been under house arrest, was ordered to wear the device after being deemed a flight risk. His aide Andriely Cirino confirmed to The Associated Press that the arrest took place around 6 a.m. on Saturday. <h3>A protest organized by Bolsonaro's son alerted the justice</h3> De Moraes said the arrest was a preventive measure to avoid a potential escape during a protest organized by his son later Saturday. \"Are you going to fight for your country or are you going to watch it all from your cellphone in your home's sofa?,\" Flávio Bolsonaro said in a video inviting people to go outside his fathers' house at 7 p.m. \"I invite you to fight with us.\" De Moraes said the attempt to break the ankle monitor was a confirmation Bolsonaro would try to escape during \"the confusion that would be caused by a demonstration organized by his son.\" The judge said there was a chance of Bolsonaro fleeing to the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia. The Supreme Court justice also mentioned other defendants in the coup case and political allies of the former president leaving Brazil to avoid jail. \"He is located about 13 kilometers (8 miles) away from where the United States of America embassy lies, in a distance that can be covered in a 15-minute drive,\" said de Moraes, who has been sanctioned by the Trump administration. In August, Brazil's federal police found messages that linked Bolsonaro to a political asylum request to Argentina, where an ally of his, Javier Milei, is president. Bolsonaro's lawyers said in a statement that the former president's arrest \"causes deep perplexity because, as (de Moraes') chronology of facts shows, it is based in a vigil for prayer,\" not a protest. The preemptive arrest of Bolsonaro, who is an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, will be discussed and voted on Monday by the five-justice Supreme Court panel that both convicted and sentenced him to prison by 4 votes to 1 in September. <h3>\"Pathetic illegal initiatives\"</h3> Local media reported that Bolsonaro, who was Brazil's president from 2019 to 2022 and remains a key political player, was expected to begin serving his sentence sometime next week after all appeals of his conviction are exhausted. Few protesters were outside the federal police headquarters in Brasilia as of Saturday morning, with more expected later as organizers of the vigil mentioned by Bolsonaro's lawyers say they will move it to where the former president is jailed. Detractors of the former president were celebrating online and scheduling parties later in the day in major Brazilian cities. \"The video shot by Flávio Bolsonaro stimulates the disrespect to the constitutional text, to the judicial decision and to (democratic) institutions, showing there's no limits for the criminal organization in its attempt to create chaos and conflict in this country, in a total disrespect to democracy,\" de Moraes wrote in his ruling. Bolsonaro and several of his allies were convicted by a panel of Supreme Court justices for attempting to overthrow Brazil's democracy following his 2022 election defeat. Prosecutors said the coup plot included plans to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. Bolsonaro was also found guilty on charges of leading an armed criminal organization and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law. He denies any wrongdoing. <h3>Bolsonaro's allies vow to defend him</h3> Fabio Wajngarten, Bolsonaro's former press adviser and lawyer, said the arrest of the former president was \"a terrible stain on the institutions.\" Speaking in a video posted on X, Wajngarten added: \"It's a shame. I hope this is reviewed soon.\" He claimed Bolsonaro's ankle monitoring device was working perfectly as of Saturday morning. \"How could something that was broken, violated, be functioning normally nine hours later?\" he wrote. \"The president had dinner — a soup — yesterday with four brothers and brothers-in-law, took medication for hiccups, felt drowsy and laid down around 10 p.m. None of his sons were at the house.\" Sóstenes Cavalcante, Bolsonaro's party whip in the lower house, accused de Moraes of showing \"psychopathy at the highest level.\" \"We will always stand by your side. Stay strong,\" he said in a video shared with the AP. \"We will respond appropriately.\" In an Instagram post, Michelle Bolsonaro, the former first lady, vowed Bolsonaro's supporters \"will not give up on our nation.\" She was outside Brasilia when her husband was arrested at home. Lula is in South Africa for a summit of the G20 group of industrialized and emerging-market nations. Gleisi Hoffmann, one of his top ministers, said on her social media channels that Bolsonaro's arrest comes after \"violent attempts of coersion\" of Supreme Court justices by the former president. <h3>\"Martyr and impactful popular leader\"</h3> Bolsonaro was placed under house arrest in early August, weeks before he was convicted. His lawyers were pleading with Brazil's Supreme Court to keep him at home to serve his sentence, citing his poor health, but Brazilian law requires that all convicts start their sentences in prison. Creomar de Souza, a political analyst with Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, a political consultancy firm based in Brasilia, said the move by de Moraes will impact next year's presidential election, with Lula seeking reelection and Bolsonaro already barred from running. \"They had the idea of turning the 2026 election into a referendum on Bolsonaro. And for that to happen they needed actions, they needed to build an optics of Bolsonaro as a martyr and an impactful popular leader,\" de Souza told the AP. \"At the end of the day, this shows the Bolsonaro family they will need to build their own alternative for the 2026 elections.",

The Saudi journalist was murdered in 2018, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, in an operation approved by the Crown Prince. \"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\" the president replied. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" Jamal Khashoggi came from a prominent Saudi family but fled his country in June, 2017, after he'd become increasingly critical of his government. He said he'd been banned from using Twitter. He began to write columns for <em>The Washington Post</em> with a candid admission: \"It was painful for me several years ago when several friends were arrested,\" he wrote. \"I said nothing. I didn't want to lose my job or my freedom. I worried about my family. I have made a different choice now. I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice. To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.\" The following summer, the Crown Prince lifted the traditional ban on women driving. But first his government arrested numerous women's rights advocates, accusing them of \"nefarious contacts with foreign parties.\" \"The message is clear to all,\" wrote Khashoggi. \"Activism of any sort has to be within the government, and no independent voice or counter-opinion will be allowed. Everyone must stick to the party line.\" Just a few months after he wrote those words, Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to pick up documents for his marriage. His fiancée waited outside for him, for hours. Khashoggi never got out of that building. But his voice went on. His last column, published after his death, called for free expression in the Arab world, and warned that the region's governments \"have been given free rein to continue silencing the media.\" Khashoggi knew as he wrote that some powerful people could find his words not just \"extremely controversial,\" as President Trump put it, but threatening to their power. He wrote them anyway, whether they liked him or not.",

    "title": "Meet the peace activist who persuaded France's Macron to recognize a Palestinian state",
    "text": "PARIS — Ofer Bronchtein was brought to tears as French President Emmanuel Macron delivered his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September, recognizing a Palestinian state for the first time. \"Honestly, I cried,\" he told NPR in an interview in his Paris apartment after his return from New York. \"I see it happening in front of me and I see the full room of the General Assembly and everyone is applauding.\" Bronchtein says his only regret is that the Israeli delegation walked out of the General Assembly. The Israeli and U.S. governments opposed the move. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said world leaders who recognized Palestinian statehood were granting a \"<a href=\"https://x.com/IsraeliPM_heb/status/1969790851938386153\" target=\"_blank\">tremendous reward</a>\" to the Palestinian militant group Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. Bronchtein refutes this,<strong> </strong>arguing it is no reward for a group that never sought a peaceful coexistence alongside Israel. \"I strongly believe that if there had been a Palestinian state before the 7th of October, if the Palestinians had been sovereign to run their lives as they wanted, the 7th of October [attack in Israel] would not have happened,\" he says. For Bronchtein, recognizing a Palestinian state at the U.N. was the culmination of his life's work. The 68-year-old Israeli-French activist has long promoted the recognition of a Palestinian state alongside Israel to help resolve the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In recent years, he has been doing so as an informal adviser to President Macron. Now, as the French continue efforts for a lasting peace in the region, the president's unofficial envoy is pushing for Paris to play a lead role in the process. <h3>Talking peace over whisky in Ramallah</h3> Bronchtein was first introduced to Macron in 2019 by a mutual friend, he says. The next year, he and the French leader formed a bond during a presidential visit to Jerusalem, where Macron gave a speech on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, and Bronchtein was serving as Hebrew interpreter for France's delegation. On that trip, as Bronchtein tells it, during a late-night whisky they shared in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Macron said he wanted Bronchtein to work with him on peace in the Middle East. Macron understands the issues, and empathizes with both Israelis and Palestinians, Bronchtein explains. The president was looking for a way for France and Europe to play a larger role in the peace process. Bronchtein, president of the nonprofit International Forum for Peace, receives no salary for consulting Macron, he says. He's sitting at his desk covered with books and papers in the cluttered yet cozy Paris apartment he shares with his wife, American photographer Hally Pencer, and their Labrador Leo.  Bronchtein's only condition is a direct line to Macron. \"I whisper in his ear usually after 12 o'clock at night,\" when the president's more available, Bronchtein says. \"My job is to give some ideas, to react to what's happening on the ground. Sometimes he listens to what I have to say, sometimes he doesn't.\" A few months after that Middle East trip, Macron gave Bronchtein his first mission: to find ideas that could bring Palestinians and Israelis together. The activist spoke with hundreds of people across both societies, and assembled what he calls a suggestion toolbox. On top: Arab states should normalize relations with Israel, while Israel should recognize a sovereign Palestinian state. And France should lead the way on statehood recognition. \"When the time comes,\" Bronchtein recalls Macron always saying. <h3>Life in and out of Israel and France</h3> Bronchtein has French and Israeli passports, as well as a Palestinian one. He was born in the Negev desert town of Beersheba, Israel, in 1957. All of his grandparents were born in what was then Ottoman-controlled Palestine. His paternal grandparents moved to Tunisia, then a French protectorate, where they gained French citizenship. Bronchtein's father, at age 16, left Tunisia for France, and joined the Jewish resistance against the Nazis. After World War II, his father boarded the <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/exodus-1947\" target=\"_blank\">Exodus 1947</a>, a ship filled with hundreds of Holocaust survivors sailing from France to start their lives over in Palestine, which was then under British mandate. He went on to fight both the Arabs and the British for Israeli statehood in 1948. Bronchtein calls his father his hero. Then in 1966, when Bronchtein was 9, the family left Israel for economic reasons and moved to an immigrant suburb of Paris. Bronchtein returned to Israel in 1975, at age 17. And there he began a lifelong fight for social justice, peace and reconciliation between Israelis and Arabs. <h3>Jailed for meeting a Palestinian official</h3> He worked on building bridges across the divide, even when it was forbidden. In 1987, Bronchtein met in Spain with a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Mahmoud Abbas. (It was nearly two decades before Abbas became president of the Palestinian Authority.) Their encounter in Spain broke Israel's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/20/world/israeli-parliament-lifts-a-ban-on-plo-contacts.html\" target=\"_blank\">ban on contacts with PLO</a> representatives at the time. Bronchtein served 15 days in Israeli prison. Things turned around when he became an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin during the negotiations leading to the 1990s <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1993-2000/oslo\" target=\"_blank\">Oslo Accords</a>. Signed by Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the peace agreements outlined plans for a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Bronchtein remembers the hope surrounding that era. \"After that it was like a honeymoon,\" he says. \"I was living in Tel Aviv at the time. I would take my car and an hour later I was on the beach in Gaza, having dinner with my friends. I did the same thing in the West Bank. We were going in and out without any problem. Many of the Palestinians I met became dear friends of mine.\" He says Palestinians enjoyed some of that freedom too, for a time, but it didn't last. In 1995, Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist. Israelis who opposed the Oslo Accords came to power. A Palestinian uprising known as the second intifada began in 2000. Bronchtein grew cynical and life became dangerous in Israel, with Palestinian attacks on buses. He and his wife moved to France with their three children. <h3>Renewed hope for peace</h3> Bronchtein says his hope eventually returned, thanks to dear friends on both sides of the conflict, and the desire for peaceful coexistence that those who know him best say is part of his soul. In 2002, Bronchtein and a Palestinian partner, Anis al-Qaq, created the <a href=\"https://www.forumforpeace.com/en/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">International Forum for Peace</a> to foster dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. \"Bronchtein is unique,\" says John Lyndon, executive director of Alliance for Middle East Peace, a network of organizations promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. While Bronchtein's peace forum is not a member of the alliance, Lyndon says the two have partnered together on recent initiatives. \"What's great about Ofer is that he's brought civil society's voice and impatience into what can often be sterile governmental context,\" he says. \"He hasn't lost the fact that he's an activist. I've seen him be the person in the meeting that is maybe upsetting the diplomats by saying the thing they need to hear. He maintains his access and his conversations with Macron, but he also speaks truth to power.\" As a gesture for his work, Palestinian Authority President Abbas gave Bronchtein a Palestinian passport in 2011. But the Israeli-French peace activist has drawn detractors, too. France has Europe's <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2025/06/09/jewish-population-change/\" target=\"_blank\">largest Jewish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/\" target=\"_blank\">Muslim communities</a>, and Middle East tensions often play out in the country. Bronchtein says he receives insults from different sides over his activism, and even death threats from extremist Jews in France and Israel. He has refused President Macron's offer of a security detail. <h3>\"Pushing the American president in the right direction\"</h3> Bronchtein has been a strong critic of Israel's occupation of the West Bank after the Arab-Israeli war in 1967. He believes it goes against Jewish values and dehumanizes Palestinians, which has also fueled Palestinian hatred toward Israelis. And recently, Palestinians in the West Bank have seen an increase in their land confiscated and violence against them by Israeli settlers. But the level of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the last two years is something Bronchtein says he never imagined. \"To tell you honestly, I feel ashamed as an Israeli that some people in my name committed this terrible crime,\" he says of Israel's vast destruction of Gaza. \"And lately, when I speak in front of Palestinians or even in the media, I ask for forgiveness. I hope that one day the Palestinians will forgive us for what's happened in Gaza.\" He says Palestinians should also ask forgiveness from Israel \"for the terrible things Hamas did on Oct. 7.\" In the wake of such destruction and loss, Bronchtein thinks there is a real chance to change the status quo. He says \"a lot of Israelis would like to make peace.\" But lasting peace will only be achieved when Palestinians are masters of their own destiny. He believes Hamas will one day be vanquished, but says: \"You cannot kill an ideology through violence. You kill ideology by giving people a chance to hope for a better future.\" France's diplomatic move at the U.N. was deeply planned and coordinated for months with Saudi Arabia, and led countries to revive the call for a two-state solution. Israel <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-response-emmanuel-macron-palestine-france-statehood-politics/\" target=\"_blank\">threatened retaliation</a> for it, and President Trump initially warned it could \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5550295\" target=\"_blank\">encourage continued conflict</a>.\" But Bronchtein and other <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-10-05/ty-article/.premium/despite-the-ridicule-macrons-two-state-initiative-heavily-affected-trumps-gaza-plan/00000199-b096-d9d3-ab9b-f2df55430000?gift=af50c9e6772a4cfbb991139f736843f5\" target=\"_blank\">analysts believe</a> France's move helped lay the groundwork for President Trump's plan for peace in Gaza. Bronchtein says it's time for Israelis and Palestinians to write a new narrative, much like the Europeans did after the destruction of World War II. It should be a project for the future where they are not enemies, but eventually partners, he says. A narrative that respects the history, the identity and the pain of each side.",

    "title": "How Marjorie Taylor Greene went from a top Trump ally to choosing to resign",
    "text": "Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene became a household name in the run up to the 2020 election<strong> </strong>for divisive rhetoric, political stunts and enthusiastic support of President Trump. But after growing disagreements with Trump during his second term, Greene announced she will leave Congress in January before her term is up. Greene said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them \"endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for\" while noting that \"Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\" Greene's split with Trump widened in recent weeks as she pushed for the release of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. For months, Greene had been publicly pressing Trump and top Republicans in Congress to release all files from two federal investigations into Epstein. She was part of a small cadre of Republicans who helped force a vote on the House floor to release the files — a process that drove Trump to reverse his position on the documents and led to near-unanimous support for the measure this week. But before Trump reversed course, he lashed out last week, calling her \"Marjorie Traitor Greene,\" and told reporters, \"Something happened to her over the last period of a month or two where she changed politically.\" In her post Friday night, Greene defended her decision to fight for the release of those documents.  \"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene wrote. <h3>Greene's defiant push against Trump</h3> On a brisk morning this week, Greene stood outside the Capitol with some of the women who say they were abused by Epstein. \"I've never owed him anything,\" Greene of the president on Tuesday. \"But I fought for him and for America First. And he called me a traitor for standing with these women.\" The cracks between Trump and Greene grew over the last year, as Greene increasingly pointed out where she saw the president falling short: <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1950000279593607551\" target=\"_blank\"><u>she called the war in Gaza a genocide</u></a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1937182967995982230?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>criticized Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities</u></a>, and pressed for expiring health subsidies to be extended, citing the threat of skyrocketing premiums for people in her district, <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1975337063697555652\" target=\"_blank\"><u>including her own children</u></a>. And she was doing it not just on social media or right-wing outlets, but on programs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltGQRmn-HIk\" target=\"_blank\"><u>ABC's </u><em><u>The View</u></em><u>.</u></a> <h3>\"What Happened to Marjorie?\"</h3> \"I was thinking, if this was the first time I'd ever seen this person, it sounds like a normal congressperson from Schoolhouse Rock,\" said University of North Georgia professor Nathan Price after Greene's appearance on the daytime television staple. For some, this new persona may be hard to square with the Greene many Americans first got to know: the congresswoman who embraced QAnon conspiracy theories, liked a post that called for violence against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. and heckled school shooting survivor David Hogg in 2020, before he became a prominent political activist. Even Trump has publicly mused in recent weeks: \"What happened to Marjorie?\" Georgia Republican strategist Brian Robinson says it's a fair question. \"I am open to the idea that she's had a 'road to Damascus' moment, a conversion, that she sees the errors of the toxicity and wants something that's better,\" Robinson said in an interview with NPR earlier in the week. On her own social media and with journalists, Greene has been open about addressing claims from Trump and others that she has changed or abandoned the president. NPR reached out to Greene for further comment. \"Nothing has changed about me,\" Greene told the hosts of <em>The View</em>. \"I'm staying absolutely 100% true to the people who voted for me, and true to my district.\" Robinson said the changes could be part of a natural evolution for Greene, a former CrossFit gym owner from the Atlanta suburbs. \"We love to elect outsiders to Congress,\" Robinson said. \"They go to Congress with very little idea of how it works. And if at some point you're like, 'I want to do substantive things that make America better, then I've got to do this a little bit different.\" Or, Robinson said, she may be trying to broaden her appeal with an important constituency as she weighs a bid for higher office. Trump said last week he showed Greene polling earlier this year suggesting she would flounder in a race for Georgia governor or Senate. \"Is she intentionally signaling to women, 'The good old boys club ignores us, and I understand your struggles?\" Robinson said. Both Robinson and Price said Greene's evolution was more about style than substance. She has disavowed some of her more controversial views, but not others, like the unproven assertion that widespread fraud upended the 2020 election result. The anti-interventionist, anti-elite principles that first propelled her to Congress also remain core to her identity. \"What she's responding to is believing that the President has shifted on these issues,\" said Price. Some potential political opponents see an opportunity in Greene's break with Trump. Robinson, who worked for Greene's opponent in her first primary race, says in the past he has warned potential challengers not to underestimate her. \"You are wasting your time,\" Robinson said. \"She will beat you. And I would have said that into infinity until this week.\" <h3><strong>How Greene's district reacted to the shift</strong></h3> But in the 14th Congressional District, it was not clear this week that anything had changed. As chair of the Paulding County Republican Party, Ricky Hess spends a lot of time talking with voters. \"The issues that they want to talk about involve high property taxes, high health care costs, whether or not their kids will be able to buy a house when they graduate,\" Hess said this week ahead of Greene's resignation<strong>.</strong>  Hess told NPR he believes<strong> </strong>Greene's \"America First\" worldview resonates in this heavily working class and rural stretch of Northwest Georgia. \"She's pretty tapped into what her constituents are wanting, and I have to believe that most of her actions are in service to that,\" Hess said. Hess said voters saw Trump and Greene as fighters on the same team. Though Martha Zoller, who hosts a political talk radio show that airs across North Georgia, said in an interview Wednesday she didn't believe everyone's minds were made up. \"People are kind of reeling, if you want to know the truth,\" Zoller said. \"We haven't had a lot of listeners discussing it because they're waiting to see what happens.\" Georgia political observers noted that Greene has been anything but a predictable politician — including her surprise resignation.  Trump has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168017/2024-election-georgia-donald-trump-brian-kemp\" target=\"_blank\"><u>come to a truce with other politicians</u></a> he's feuded with, including Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. And his future relationship with Greene could still evolve. But Zoller said the conflict between Trump and Greene has been about more than just two big personalities falling out on the national stage. \"I think that the big discussion we're going to be having as Republicans over the next few years is what is the Republican movement once it's not Trump?\" Zoller said earlier this week it seemed clear that Greene wants to be part of that discussion. But with her resignation, the answer to that question is may be less clear  now than before.<br> <em>NPR's Stephen Fowler contributed to this report.</em>",

    "title": "Trump says he's terminating legal protections for Somali migrants in Minnesota",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Friday night that he's \"immediately\" terminating temporary legal protections for Somali migrants living in Minnesota, further targeting a program seeking to limit deportations that his administration has already repeatedly sought to weaken. Minnesota has the nation's largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs. But how many migrants would be affected by Trump's announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide. Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments. The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was \"a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\" \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,\" Trump wrote. \"It's OVER!\" The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump's decision \"will tear families apart.\" Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said in a statement late Friday, \"This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.\" Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally. That included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under President Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that found Texas' 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by President Trump likely discriminates on the basis of race. The order signed by Justice Samuel Alito will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map favorable to Republicans to be used in the midterm elections. The court's conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections. The order came about an hour after the state called on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections. The order was signed by Alito because he is the justice who handles emergency appeals from Texas. Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump's efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year's elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case. If that ruling eventually holds, Texas could be forced to hold elections next year using the map drawn by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 based on the 2020 census. Texas was the first state to meet Trump's demands in what has become an expanding national battle over redistricting. Republicans drew the state's new map to give the GOP five additional seats, and Missouri and North Carolina followed with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. To counter those moves, California voters approved a ballot initiative to give Democrats an additional five seats there. The redrawn maps are facing court challenges in California, Missouri and North Carolina. The Supreme Court is separately considering a case from Louisiana which could further limit race-based districts under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It's not entirely clear how the current round of redistricting would be affected by the outcome in the Louisiana case.",

    "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who rose to prominence as one of President Trump's biggest defenders and recently became one of his biggest critics, is leaving Congress. In a nearly <a href=\"https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1992035608387039359?s=20\" target=\"_blank\"><u>11-minute video statement</u></a>, Greene excoriated the Republican Party, House leadership and the start of campaign season \"which means all courage leaves and only safe campaign re-election mode is turned on.\" Greene's announcement late Friday that she would resign effective Jan. 5, 2026, is the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/nx-s1-5611107/epstein-files-mtg-trump-maga-gop\" target=\"_blank\"><u>latest escalation</u></a> of months of clashes with the president over his second term agenda – including the release of the Epstein files. \"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said.<strong> </strong> Trump's campaign promise to release files related to the life and death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – and the numerous ways the president stonewalled the release this year before ultimately relenting this week – was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. The third-term congresswoman also said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them \"endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for\" while noting that \"Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\" \"It's all so absurd and completely unserious,\" she said. \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife,' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\" Greene is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/15/nx-s1-5534254/house-senate-retirement-tracker-2026\" target=\"_blank\"><u>one of a record 40 House members and 10 senators</u></a> who have indicated they do not plan to return to their seats after the 2026 election, joining a number of lawmakers who are retiring or running for a different office. Her resignation will likely set up a special election to finish the rest of her term in the spring. The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/nx-s1-5611107/epstein-files-mtg-trump-maga-gop\" target=\"_blank\"><u>fracturing of Trump's MAGA coalition</u></a> has been developing for months, with splits over foreign policy issues like bombing Iran and the support of Israel's war in Gaza accompanying questions about domestic effects of tariffs. Greene has been a vocal opponent each time.  Greene has remained ideologically consistent throughout her time in Congress and with her criticism of Trump. Her argument is that the president and the Republican Party have changed and fallen short of the Make America Great Again and America First vision. Notably, her announcement video also blasted the \"political industrial complex of both political parties\" that focuses on which side \"can convince Americans to hate the other side more.\"  \"And the results are always the same, no matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat,\" she said. \"Nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman.\" Greene's retirement announcement comes at a time when the Republican Party – and Trump – are facing a number of setbacks, including defeats up and down the ballot in this month's elections and poor economic headwinds. Now, there is a large and visible dent in the previously impenetrable armor that is Trump's control over the party and its future, accelerating the inevitable questions around what a post-Trump GOP would look like.",

    "text": "As the National Women's Soccer League <a href=\"https://www.nwslsoccer.com/championship\" target=\"_blank\">finals</a> kick off on Saturday in San Jose, Calif., fans of the <a href=\"https://washingtonspirit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Spirit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gothamfc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gotham FC</a> are bringing more than jerseys and banners. They're bringing an entire culture of singing and chanting that has become central to the league's game-day experience. For supporters of the Washington D.C. team, that energy has been building all season. The <a href=\"https://spiritsquadron.club/\" target=\"_blank\">Spirit Squadron</a>, one of the club's major fan groups, has spent months preparing the repertoire they'll unleash from the stands on Saturday. \"We have a chant just for when we score,\" said Squadron president Meredith Bartley, of a raucous, snare drum-laced chant celebrating getting the ball into the back of the net. It's set to the nursery song \"The Animals Went in Two by Two.\" There's a chant (with the endearing refrain \"You're my favorite soccer team!\") for when fans are simply having a blast. And there's one rooted in local politics. \"This season, we've started in the 51st minute a 'Free D.C.' chant,\" Bartley said. The chant nods to the long-standing push for D.C. home rule and statehood, and grew out of heightened tensions earlier this year, when the Trump administration took control of the district's police force and deployed National Guard troops to the city. <h3><strong>Borrowing from the global soccer canon</strong></h3> Spirit supporters also borrow from the global soccer canon. When the energy in the stadium dips, they'll sometimes launch into a playful chant appropriated from English Premier League crowds. \"Let's pretend we scored a goal,\" they repeat. New York and New Jersey-based <a href=\"https://www.gothamfc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gotham FC</a> supporters — who will be cheering on the Spirit's opponents in the championship match — have similarly embraced U.K. soccer songs. One in particular has become an anthem. John Denver's \"Take Me Home, Country Roads,\" famously sung by Manchester United fans at their stadium, Old Trafford, has taken on a new life in the tri-state area. In 2023, Gotham FC fans reworked the song into \"Gotham Roads,\" a tribute to the team and the region. \"To use 'Country Roads' was actually my idea,\" said Marge Liguori, who leads <a href=\"https://cloud9goth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud 9</a>, a big Gotham FC supporters group. \"I do also happen to be a Manchester United fan. So I kind of borrowed that, but worked with other fans to adapt the lyrics.\" <h3><strong>All in it together</strong></h3> For Liguori, the song resonates because it evokes a sense of home. \"I think that's what we find in our arena and in our community with our team,\" she said. This feeling of belonging is paramount to understanding why singing and chanting are such an integral part of sports events. \"Really, the team is more of just a metaphor for the community,\" said Max Jack, an ethnomusicologist and anthropologist at Indiana University who has studied the intersection of sports and music. He said singing and chanting allow fans to go through the emotional journey that is a soccer game together. \"It creates a sense of stranger intimacy that is incredibly deep and fulfilling,\" Jack said. \"It offers something that most people won't access in their day-to-day life.\" That intimacy extends beyond fan-to-fan relationships. Chants also help build bonds between supporters and the players they root for. After Gotham FC's 2023 NWSL championship, fans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA_dH88pvDo\" target=\"_blank\">serenaded</a> defender Mandy Freeman as she approached the stands. Freeman wiped away tears as she hugged fans across the railings. Those interactions — along with the fans' overall enthusiasm — matter to the team, Jeff Greer, Gotham FC's vice president of communications, told NPR. \"When we hear them chanting, we know that they are at our backs pushing us to victory,\" he said. The Spirit feel the same way. Their home matches at Audi Field in Washington D.C. are known for their high-octane atmosphere. \"Our players regularly credit 'Rowdy Audi' for being the 12th player on the field,\" said Spirit director of communications Ben Kessler. \"And a lot of that is because of how creative their chants and cheers are.",

    "title": "Senate Democrats are investigating the Kennedy Center for 'cronyism, corruption'",
    "text": "The ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees public buildings, <a href=\"https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-democratic?ID=18AB0102-81C2-45C9-AA8F-7091CD691AB8\" target=\"_blank\"><u>is investigating leadership</u></a> at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for what he says are \"millions in lost revenue, luxury spending, and preferential treatment for Trump allies.\" The committee's ranking member Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) sent a letter outlining the claims to Kennedy Center president, Richard Grenell. Grenell denied the allegations in a letter that was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BcB7ayowt/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>posted</u></a> to the Kennedy Center's social media. The Kennedy Center's building is maintained by the federal government, though its programming and staff are supported by a combination of private and federal funds. Whitehouse's letter, plus documentation obtained by Democrats on the Senate committee, are <a href=\"https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2025/11/whitehouse-launches-investigation-into-cronyism-corruption-at-kennedy-center-under-grenell\" target=\"_blank\"><u>posted on its website</u></a>. The documents appear to show that non-arts groups are getting significant discounts on rental fees at the Kennedy Center. There is a copy of a contract with FIFA that shows the international soccer organization will not pay the usual $5 million in rental fees when it takes over the center for three weeks in order to announce next year's World Cup draw, as first <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/11/13/fifa-kennedy-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>reported</u></a> by <em>The Washington Post</em>. Senate Democrats obtained copies of contracts given to Grenell's friends and associates, worth tens of thousands of dollars. In his letter to Grenell, Whitehouse said these and other actions show a \"profound disregard\" for leadership's \"fiduciary responsibility.\" Allegations of financial mismanagement come at a time of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5554310/where-are-kennedy-center-audiences-going\" target=\"_blank\"><u>declining</u></a> audiences, artist <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/06/nx-s1-5319979/hamilton-kennedy-center-cancel\" target=\"_blank\"><u>cancellations</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5538440/jazz-director-kennedy-center-trump\" target=\"_blank\"><u>layoffs</u></a> and resignations at the Kennedy Center. An <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/10/31/kennedy-center-sales/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>analysis</u></a> by <em>The Washington Post</em> found that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center have taken a nosedive; on average, 43% of tickets have not been sold since early September. On the same day as the <em>Post</em>'s reporting, Grenell <a href=\"https://x.com/RichardGrenell/status/1984311104328384965?s=20\" target=\"_blank\"><u>announced</u></a> the center had raised \"a record-breaking\" $58 million from donors and sponsors in 30 days \"with more on the horizon.\" In his response to Whitehouse, Grenell <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/19xgMcCkJa/?mibextid=wwXIfr\" target=\"_blank\"><u>wrote</u></a> that he is \"concerned about your careless attacks on me and my team\" and that the Senator's letter is \"filled with partisan attacks and false accusations.\" Grenell denied Whitehouse's claims and alleged financial mismanagement by the center's previous leadership, including \"a bloated staff\" and \"deferred maintenance\" that \"was quite literally making the building fall apart.\" President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/nx-s1-5477484/republicans-want-to-rename-the-kennedy-centers-opera-house-after-melania-trump\" target=\"_blank\"><u>includes</u></a> $257 million for repairs, maintenance and restoration of the Kennedy Center. Addressing the claim that FIFA will be using the center for free, instead of paying a $5 million rental fee to the Kennedy Center, Grenell said the international soccer organization has \"given us several million dollars, in addition to paying all of the expenses for this event in lieu of a rental fee.…A simple rental fee would not have been enough to cover the magnitude of the event.\" Grenell has slammed previous Kennedy Center leadership a number of times. In this week's letter to Whitehouse, he wrote that \"for the first time in decades, we have a balanced budget at the Kennedy Center.\" In May he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5405565/kennedy-center-trump-deborah-rutter\" target=\"_blank\"><u>told</u></a> the Kennedy Center board the \"deferred maintenance of the Kennedy Center is criminal.\" Former Kennedy Center president Deborah Rutter and board chair David Rubenstein <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5405565/kennedy-center-trump-deborah-rutter\" target=\"_blank\"><u>rejected</u></a> Grenell's characterization of their work. Rutter wrote, \"Perhaps those now in charge are facing significant financial gaps and are seeking to attribute them to past management.\" In a statement to NPR from May, Rubenstein said, \"financial reports were reviewed and approved by the Kennedy Center's audit committee and full board as well as a major accounting firm.\" That audit committee included board members appointed by Trump during his first term, <a href=\"https://floridapolitics.com/archives/390461-bondi-kennedy/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>including</u></a> U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, she was a special advisor to Trump and worked on his defense team during his Senate impeachment trial. Whitehouse is requesting the Kennedy Center supply him with \"documents and information about the Center's financial management practices, expenditures, donors, and contracts under Grenell's leadership by December 4, 2025.\"<br> <em>This story was edited by Jennifer Vanasco.</em>",

    "title": "The female crash test dummy has been a long time coming — but she isn't here yet",
    "text": "When the Trump administration announced it was <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/trumps-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-design-first-its-kind-advanced\" target=\"_blank\"><u>giving the green light</u></a> to the design for a female crash test dummy, it was welcome news to the advocates who have long fought for better female representation in vehicle safety. This dummy has been on a long journey. And she's not at the end of the road yet. Vehicle safety tests in the U.S. use crash test dummies based on a male body. Advocates say it's no coincidence that women are more likely to suffer injuries in car crashes than men, even if you control for the severity of the crash and the size of the vehicle. Calls for an accurate female crash test dummy date back decades. <em>Consumer Reports</em> has <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/crash-test-bias-how-male-focused-testing-puts-female-drivers-at-risk/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>traced them back to 1980</u></a>. In the early 2000s, regulators added a small \"female\" dummy to tests — but it was just a scaled-down version of the male dummy, with breasts attached. That doesn't reflect the real anatomical differences between male and female bodies. Around the same time, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) started thinking about creating a more accurate female dummy. For more than a decade, NHTSA has worked with Humanetics, the leading manufacturer of crash test dummies, to develop, build and test the dummy that the Trump administration unveiled this week. The new dummy is called the THOR-05F, or Test device for Human Occupant Restraint, 5th-percentile Female. (That is to say, a very small woman.) It's actually based on the female body. \"The pelvis for a female is more rounded and does not hold the seatbelt the same way,\" says Chris O'Connor, the CEO of manufacturing company Humanetics. He also pointed to anatomical differences in the neck, and significant differences in the lower leg that are correlated with much higher rates of leg injuries in women. The dummy's design had previously been embraced by some regulators overseas, with European officials indicating plans to add it to tests within a few years. But it had been stuck in limbo in the U.S., where for several years NHTSA said that more testing and consideration was required before formally adopting the dummy. Adding a new dummy to the crash testing process will be costly — aside from the costs of development, individual dummies can each cost more than $1 million. The new design also won't necessarily represent all women; it has been criticized for being extremely small, rather than reflecting an average body size. Some safety groups <a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/improving-safety-for-women-requires-more-than-a-female-crash-test-dummy\" target=\"_blank\"><u>have argued</u></a> that using computer simulations, which can model bodies of various sizes, is a good way to diversify testing, although others say that having better real-life crash test data to feed <em>into </em>those models is essential. So the road to this week's announcement from the Department of Transportation has been winding. \"This is a long overdue step toward the full adoption of this new dummy for use in our safety ratings and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards,\" wrote NHTSA administrator Jonathan Morrison. And the publication of technical documents and specifications is, indeed, just one step. A final rule still has to be published, and then the new dummy \"will be considered\" for inclusion in actual safety tests, the Department of Transportation writes in its <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/trumps-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-design-first-its-kind-advanced\" target=\"_blank\"><u>press release</u></a>. Those tests have not yet been rewritten to include the new design. In a statement emailed to NPR, NHTSA says that the agency is using the female dummy in its own research, and that the new release \"provides the information the auto industry needs\" to start using it as well. But as for the federal New Car Assessment Program, which assigns safety ratings to new vehicles, the process of incorporating the new dummy will start in 2027-2028. Women Drive Too, an advocacy group that has long pushed for the use of female crash test dummies, welcomed this week's news in measured tones. \"We applaud this action, but by itself, it won't be enough,\" the coalition <a href=\"https://www.womendrivetoo.com/statement-on-nhtsa-approval/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>wrote in a statement</u></a>. They're still pushing for Congress to pass a law that requires the dummies actually get used in real-life crash tests. After decades of planning, the use of the new dummies in actual federal safety tests is still a few years away.<br>",

    "title": "Putin says U.S. plan for Ukraine could form the basis for a final peace settlement",
    "text": "KYIV, Ukraine — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday cautiously welcomed a U.S. proposal to end Moscow's nearly four-year war in Ukraine, saying it \"could form the basis of a final peace settlement.\" Putin said Moscow had received the plan, which he called \"a new version\" and \"a modernized plan,\" which he said \"could form the basis for a final peace settlement.\" \"But this text has not been discussed with us in any substantive way, and I can guess why,\" Putin said in Moscow. \"The U.S. administration has so far been unable to secure the consent of the Ukrainian side. Ukraine is against it. Apparently, Ukraine and its European allies are still under illusions and the dream of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield.\" Earlier Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address that his country is at a pivotal point in its four-year fight to defeat <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\">Russia's invasion</a>, with Ukrainians potentially facing a choice between standing up for their sovereign rights or losing American support as leaders negotiate a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-plan-92b2c89b62f4326ff67abc5613c9b59e\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. peace proposal</a>. The U.S. plan contains many of Putin's longstanding demands while offering limited security guarantees to Ukraine. It foresees Ukraine handing over territory to Russia, something Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out, reduces the size of it army and blocks its coveted path to NATO membership. Zelenskyy pledged to hold constructive discussions with Washington at what he called \"truly one of the most difficult moments in our history.\" Zelenskyy said he spoke for almost an hour Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll about the peace proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump in a radio interview on Friday said that he wants an answer from Zelenskyy on his 28-point plan by Thursday, but says an extension is possible to finalize terms. \"I've had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines,\" Trump said in an interview on the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio. \"But Thursday is it — we think an appropriate time.\" While Zelenskyy has offered to negotiate with the U.S. and Russia, he signaled Ukraine may not get everything it wants and has to confront the possibility of losing American support if it makes a stand. \"Currently, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the hardest,\" Zelenskyy said in a recorded speech. \"Ukraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner.\" \"We will work calmly with America and all partners,\" he said, but insisted on fair treatment. He urged Ukrainians to \"stop fighting\" each other, in a possible reference to a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-corruption-scandal-zelenskyy-yermak-01e6310b700b84cd79a80bd9bfb98fd4\" target=\"_blank\">major corruption scandal</a> that has brought fierce criticism of the government, and said peace talks next week \"will be very difficult.\" <h3>Europe says it will keep supporting Ukraine</h3> Zelenskyy spoke earlier by phone with the leaders of Germany, France and the United Kingdom, who assured him of their continued support, as European officials scrambled to respond to the U.S. proposals that apparently caught them unawares. Wary of antagonizing Trump, the European and Ukrainian responses were cautiously worded and pointedly commended American peace efforts. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer assured Zelenskyy of \"their unchanged and full support on the way to a lasting and just peace\" in Ukraine, Merz's office said. The four leaders welcomed U.S. efforts to end the war. \"In particular, they welcomed the commitment to the sovereignty of Ukraine and the readiness to grant Ukraine solid security guarantees,\" the statement added. The line of contact must be the departure point for an agreement, they said, and \"the Ukrainian armed forces must remain in a position to defend the sovereignty of Ukraine effectively.\" Starmer said the right of Ukraine to \"determine its future under its sovereignty is a fundamental principle.\" <h3>Existential threat to Europe</h3> European countries see their own futures at stake in Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion and have insisted on being consulted in peace efforts. \"Russia's war against Ukraine is an existential threat to Europe. We all want this war to end. But how it ends matters,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in Brussels. \"Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded. Ultimately, the terms of any agreement are for Ukraine to decide.\" Trump in his radio interview pushed back against the notion that the settlement, which offers plentiful concessions to Russia, would embolden Putin to carry out further malign action on his European neighbors. \"He's not thinking of more war,\" Trump said of Putin. \"He's thinking punishment. Say what you want. I mean, this was supposed to be a one-day war that has been four years now.\" A European government official said that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-peace-plan-europe-witkoff-33545b140c5bfbbc5e9061a739802e54\" target=\"_blank\">the U.S. plans</a> weren't officially presented to Ukraine's European backers. Many of the proposals are \"quite concerning,\" the official said, adding that a bad deal for Ukraine would also be a threat to broader European security. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the plan publicly. European Council President Antonio Costa in Johannesburg said of the U.S. proposals: \"The European Union has not been communicated (about) any plans in (an) official manner.\" <h3>Ukraine examines the proposals</h3> Ukrainian officials said they were weighing the U.S. proposals, and Zelenskyy said he expected to talk to Trump about it in coming days. A U.S. team began drawing up the plan soon after U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Rustem Umerov, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, according to a senior Trump administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that Umerov agreed to most of the plan, after making several modifications, and then presented it to Zelenskyy. However, Umerov on Friday denied that version of events. He said he only organized meetings and prepared the talks. He said technical talks between the U.S. and Ukraine were continuing in Kyiv. \"We are thoughtfully processing the partners' proposals within the framework of Ukraine's unchanging principles — sovereignty, people's security, and a just peace,\" he said.",

    "title": "South Africa hosts G20 as tensions with U.S. flare amid boycott",
    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The world's<strong> </strong>biggest economy will be conspicuously absent from a meeting of the globe's 20 richest nations this weekend, as the U.S. boycotts the G20 Leaders' Summit hosted by South Africa. The Trump administration is snubbing the event over false race-based claims and what it considers the summit's DEI – diversity, equity and inclusion -- agenda. Since returning to office Trump has accused the South African government of confiscating white-owned land and allowing the killing of white Afrikaners. \"You know we have a G20 meeting in South Africa, South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs anymore, because what happened there is bad,\" Trump said earlier this month. The government here has repeatedly tried to correct the U.S. administration, to no avail. Ramaphosa has kept his cool and was taciturn this week, saying: \"Their absence is their loss.\" Still, it's a huge blow to South Africa on the global stage. President Javier Milei of Argentina announced he isn't coming in solidarity with Trump. The leader of the world's second biggest economy, Chinese President Xi Jinping, is also not attending – though not as a slight – he isn't travelling internationally much these days. Then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin who can't come as he'd face arrest under an International Criminal Court warrant over the war in Ukraine. William Gumede, an associate professor at Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University, says the summit controversy is a sign of the times. \"It is symbolic of the fractured global moment that we are in… it's almost an alternative summit without China and without America,\" Gumede told NPR. The summit's themes of \"solidarity, equality, sustainability\" are anathema to the U.S. administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying South Africa is pushing a quote \"DEI and climate change\" agenda. However other countries whose leaders <em>are</em> attending, like Germany, have praised the theme. <h3><strong>U.S. Spat deepens</strong></h3> As foreign leaders like British Prime Minister Keir Starmer started to arrive in South Africa on Friday, the  U.S.-South Africa spat deepened after Ramaphosa said the U.S. had made an eleventh-hour request to send a delegation after all. \"We have received notice from the United States…about a change of mind about participating in one shape, form or another in the Summit,\" he said. \"We still need to engage with them fully on what their participation at the 11th hour means.\" However, the South African leader said \"the United States being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be there, so it is pleasing there is a change of approach.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back angrily. \"The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa, I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States and that language is not appreciated,\" she said. She said because the U.S. is taking over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa, the embassy's chargé d'affaires—seen as a junior official -- would be there for the symbolic hand over. However Ramaphosa's spokesman said on X, quote \"The president won't hand over to a chargé.\" One of the big questions is whether the end of the summit on Sunday will result in a joint declaration by the countries in attendance – which the  U.S. is unlikely to sign. <h3><strong>Tensions at home</strong></h3> Aside from the geopolitical wrangling over the event, there has been discontent surrounding the summit from many in South Africa. Johannesburg residents have complained the city is only getting a cleanup for foreign guests despite having had crumbling infrastructure and chronic electricity and water shortages for years. \"Oh they are fixing, the traffic lights are up…the grass has been cut, all for? G20... You're showing off for visitors but you have no regard for the people that live in that city,\" journalist Redi Tlhabi said in her popular podcast. Ahead of the summit, on Friday, thousands of women dressed in black marked a day of action against gender-based violence, staying home from work and peacefully protesting by laying flat in parks and at university campuses. The group organizing the event, Women for Change, say they wanted to call attention to the high rates of femicide and violence in South Africa as the G20 convenes. Then there's been the war of the billboards. Trump's reason for snubbing South Africa has put race relations here in the spotlight and Afrikaners have differed in their responses. One right-wing Afrikaans rights group, which agrees with Trump that whites are being persecuted, has put up large billboards welcoming G20 delegates to \"the most race-regulated country in the world\" – a reference to affirmative action laws. In response, a progressive Afrikaner association has mounted their own campaign, with billboards showing the country's beloved rugby team, the Springboks. In the photo, two smiling white Afrikaner players carry their Black captain Siya Kolisi on their shoulders. \"Terrible things are happening in South Africa,\" reads the tongue-in-cheek tagline on the billboard.",

    "title": "A new Miss Universe is crowned, weeks after she left a pageant event in protest",
    "text": "Fátima Bosch of Mexico has won this year's scandal-plagued Miss Universe competition, just days after she walked out of one of its events in protest. Bosch, 25, was crowned the new Miss Universe on Friday, capping off a chaotic few weeks of drama — both on and off the pageant stage. It started before the competition officially began, in an early November sash ceremony that was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=824666627177997\" target=\"_blank\">livestreamed on Facebook</a>. In it, Nawat Itsaragrisil — a Thai media personality and businessman who at that point was the pageant's director — stood in front of a room of begowned contestants, microphone in hand, and berated Bosch for not participating in some of its promotional activities. When Bosch stood up and tried to respond, Itsaragrisil called security to escort her out. She walked out of the room, followed by several other contestants including then-reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. Bosch <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQoFZ_pkhHJ/?igsh=MWx4NGRoN3Vjb2JnMw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">told Thai media afterward</a> that the director \"called me dumb because he has problems with the organization,\" which she said was unfair \"because I'm here and I do everything … and I'm just trying to [give] my best.\" \"And I think that the world needs to see this, because we are empowered women and this is a platform for our voice,\" she added. \"And no one can shut our voice, and no one will do that to me.\" At a press conference, a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dailymail/video/7570289399875800375\" target=\"_blank\">tearful Itsaragrisil</a> said he had not called Bosch a \"dumbhead,\" as was widely reported, but was rather speaking about \"damage\" her behavior caused. He also apologized — to Bosch, whom he did not name, and fans — <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/YlVHNS9oHjg\" target=\"_blank\">onstage at a preliminary event</a> the next day, saying the \"pressure is a lot and I am … human.\" But the fallout continued. Miss Universe Organization (MUO) President Raúl Rocha criticized him in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/2651968358477454\" target=\"_blank\">six-minute video</a>, in which he said Itsaragrisil, who is also the director of Miss Universe Thailand, \"has forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\" by showing the women a lack of respect \"in addition to the serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenseless woman, trying to silence and exclude her.\" \"Nawat, you need to stop,\" Rocha declared, adding there would be legal and corporate consequences from the organization. Rocha also said he would restrict Itsaragrisil's participation in the pageant, \"limiting it as much as possible or eliminating it entirely,\" though the two were <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRQsyd1kpPQ/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\">photographed together</a> at pageant events as recently as Thursday. In the final round of the pageant on Friday, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK3k6TYZMvs\" target=\"_blank\">Bosch was asked</a> how she would use the title of Miss Universe to \"create a safe space for women around the world.\" \"As a woman and as Miss Universe, I would put my voice in the power and the service of others,\" she replied. \"We are here to speak up, to make change … because we are women, and the brave ones that stand up are the ones that will make history.\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum — the first woman to hold that position — applauded Bosch's win at her daily press briefing on Friday. \"I like that she spoke up when she felt that was an injustice and that is an example,\" Sheinbaum said, according to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-miss-universe-bosch-sheinbaum-61580b80ed0ab5b3675e96d5cb77e3a9\" target=\"_blank\">Associated Press</a>. \"That thing they said about being prettier when you're quiet has been left behind. Women are prettier when we speak and we participate.\" <h3>Quitting judges, rigging allegations and a contestant's hospitalization</h3> The confrontation between Itsaragrisil and Bosch put Miss Universe in the spotlight weeks before the pageant kicked off. But recent days have brought even more scrutiny. This week, just before the pageant began, two out of the eight judges abruptly quit on Tuesday, just hours apart. One, French soccer player-turned-coach <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRNOAbADQ1F/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Claude Makélélé</a>, said he would not be able to attend the event \"due to unforeseen personal reasons.\" The other, Lebanese-French composer Omar Harfouch, has been much more vocal about his departure, alleging that the competition was rigged. Harfouch alleged in a number of videos and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRNAeCCiR2o/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram posts</a><strong> </strong>that two days before the final, a \"secret vote was held to pre-select 30 contestants out of the 136,\" carried out by individuals who were not official jury members. \"I could not stand before the public and television cameras, pretending to legitimize a vote I never took part in,\" he wrote. The Miss Universe Organization responded with a <a href=\"https://www.missuniverse.com/press-releases/miss-universe-press-release-18/\" target=\"_blank\">lengthy statement</a> denying Harfouch's accusations and suggesting he may have been referring to the selection committee of its \"Beyond the Crown Program,\" a separate social impact initiative with its own judging panel. \"The Miss Universe Organization firmly clarifies that no impromptu jury has been created, that no external group has been authorized to evaluate delegates or select finalists, and that all competition evaluations continue to follow the established, transparent, and supervised MUO protocols,\" it wrote. When the <a href=\"https://www.missuniverse.com/the-competition-thailand/\" target=\"_blank\">preliminary events</a> finally got underway on Wednesday, they were not without incident either. During the evening gown round, Miss Jamaica Gabrielle Henry <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRPdoV_iYvk/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">fell off the stage</a> toward the end of her walk. Social media <a href=\"https://people.com/miss-universe-contestant-taken-away-on-a-stretcher-after-falling-off-stage-at-pageant-11852912\" target=\"_blank\">videos showed her</a> being taken away on a stretcher. Henry did not compete in the finals. On Friday, Rocha, the organization president, said in an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRPv7Q9CVUJ/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram update</a> that he had just visited her and her family in a Bangkok hospital, where she is under observation but has no broken bones. Since 2024, the Miss Universe Organization has been jointly owned by the Thai media company JKN and Legacy Holding Group USA Inc., a division of a Mexican company owned by Rocha. It has changed ownership multiple times since its creation in 1952, including a nearly two-decade stretch under now-President Trump that ended in 2015. The organization has struggled with <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/miss-universe-drops-30-viewers-173317391.html\" target=\"_blank\">declining viewership</a> and <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-27/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-miss-universe-competition/103387806\" target=\"_blank\">financial instability</a> in recent years, as well as broader questions around relevance, objectification and inclusivity in the modern age. Its host country changes frequently, and Puerto Rico's Gov. Jenniffer González-Colón <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRTVjNijLVt/\" target=\"_blank\">announced Friday</a> that the island will host the competition next year.",

    "text": "On Friday night, you will be able to see the seventh planet from the sun, Uranus. <a href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/author/kelly-beatty-2/\"><strong>Kelly Beatty</strong></a>, a senior editor at Sky &amp; Telescope, joins <em>Here &amp; Now</em> with detailed instructions on what to look for. <h3>Tips for seeing Uranus</h3> <strong>Kelly Beatty</strong>: &#8220;Uranus is the third-largest planet in our solar system (three times the diameter of Earth). But its orbit is so far away, nearly 2 billion miles from the Sun, that it looks very dim in the nighttime sky. Fortunately, Uranus is at its closest to Earth all year on the night of Nov. 21, and you can find it in the evening sky using this chart from <i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Sky &amp; Telescope.</em> &#8220;You won’t be able to see Uranus just by eye — you’ll need a pair of good binoculars or a small telescope, and pick a location without bright lights nearby. &#8220;First, find the small but pretty Pleiades (“Seven Sisters”) star cluster by eye. The Pleiades are low in the eastern sky by around 7 p.m., but they’ll gradually move to almost overhead by 11 p.m. &#8220;Then look to the lower right of the Pleiades by about 5° — the width of your middle three fingertips when you hold out your arm. That’s where to point the binoculars. You’ll see an uneven row of three stars (at the lower right corner of this chart), and the one on the left end is Uranus! &#8220;If your sky is cloudy tonight, or if you can’t get to a dark location, don’t worry: Uranus will be in this same location for several weeks, and the evening sky will be free of bright moonlight until about Thanksgiving. You can also use a stargazing app on your phone to help you.&#8221; This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/11/21/uranus-visible\">WBUR.org.</a><img src=\"https://pixel.wbur.org/1055579\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;\" />",

Whatever the number, I will pass him one day and take the lead the way I do on our walks in the woods. And if this ever manages to cross his mind, it would be the sweetest shadow I have ever cast on snow or grass. DHARMA The way the dog trots out the front door every morning without a hat or an umbrella, without any money or the keys to her dog house never fails to fill the saucer of my heart with milky admiration. Who provides a finer example of a life without encumbrance— Thoreau in his curtainless hut with a single plate, a single spoon? Gandhi with his staff and his wire spectacles? Off she goes into the material world with nothing but her brown coat and her modest blue collar, following only her wet nose, the twin portals of her steady breathing, followed only by the plume of her tail. If only she did not shove the cat aside every morning and eat all his food what a model of self-containment she would be, what a paragon of earthly detachment. If only she were not so eager for a rub behind the ears, so acrobatic in her welcomes, if only I were not her god. THE REVENANT I am the dog you put to sleep, as you like to call the needle of oblivion, come back to tell you this simple thing: I never liked you—not one bit. When I licked your face, I thought of biting off your nose. When I watched you toweling yourself dry, I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap. I resented the way you moved, your lack of animal grace, the way you would sit in a chair to eat, a napkin on your lap, knife in your hand. I would have run away, but I was too weak, a trick you taught me while I was learning to sit and heel, and—greatest of insults—shake hands without a hand. I admit the sight of the leash would excite me but only because it meant I was about to smell things you had never touched. You do not want to believe this, but I have no reason to lie. I hated the car, the rubber toys, disliked your friends and, worse, your relatives. The jingling of my tags drove me mad. You always scratched me in the wrong place. All I ever wanted from you was food and fresh water in my metal bowls. While you slept, I watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky. It took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl. Now I am free of the collar, the yellow raincoat, monogrammed sweater, the absurdity of your lawn, and that is all you need to know about this place except what you already supposed and are glad it did not happen sooner— that everyone here can read and write, the dogs in poetry, the cats and all the others in prose. <em>Excerpted from &#8220;Dog Show&#8221; by Billy Collins.

    "title": "Durham public school attendance drops to COVID levels amid North Carolina immigration crackdown",
    "text": "Federal officials say they arrested around 370 people in North Carolina this week in immigration crackdowns around Charlotte and the Research Triangle. Although local officials say border patrol agents have left, the Department of Homeland Security says “Operation Charlotte’s Web” is not ending any time soon. According to officials, that has led many parents across North Carolina to keep their kids home from school this week, including in Durham. “Since Monday, our attendance took a hit. And then even as early as Wednesday and Thursday, it had increased to the 29% level in terms of the percentage of students that have been absent,&#8221; said Durham Public Schools Superintendent Anthony Lewis. “And so, what we&#8217;re seeing is that parents are still choosing to keep their children at home. Then, we do recognize that this is leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday. And so, families are just making the decision just to keep those kids at home.” <h3>5 questions with Anthony Lewis</h3> <strong>At this point, we&#8217;re talking about one out of almost every three of your students not coming into school. Have you ever seen anything like that before?</strong> “No, not recently. You know, we saw similar trends like this during COVID or the pandemic when schools had made a decision to close it, then families were elected to keep their kids home. But no, I haven&#8217;t seen anything like this in quite some time.” <strong>How disruptive is it to the day for the teachers and kids who do come to school?</strong> “That&#8217;s what I tell people. You know, I think it was [Martin Luther King Jr.] that made the quote that, ‘What impacts one directly impacts all indirectly.’ And so, it&#8217;s having a major toll on our teachers, on our students&#8217; classmates. “I was meeting with my superintendent student advisory council just the other night, and you could see the heaviness on them in terms of just concern for their classmates. &#8220;And so when you think about teachers that have to do a tremendous amount of work, planning lessons for a full classroom and then maybe walk in and maybe a third of the class is there, you know, it just kind of creates some additional stress and emotion for our educators as well, because they are so concerned about the well-being of our scholars.” <strong>The Raleigh News and Observer reported this week that community members were detained near an elementary school in Durham. Have you had any immigration agents go into your schools?</strong> “No, we haven&#8217;t seen any immigration officials going into our schools. I will tell you that we do have protocols for any visitor, and that includes local, state and federal law enforcement agencies as well. “We have protocols in place for visitors. We just don&#8217;t allow visitors in our building, particularly as it relates to immigration agents. If they do come on our campus, we have protocols in place. “For example, we have to ensure that they have a signed judicial warrant, signed by a judge or a magistrate. &#8220;The protocols allow for our administrators to then contact our legal department. We work with our sheriff&#8217;s department to make sure that our students remain safe. &#8220;But we did have an incident, maybe a block away from one of our elementary schools, where agents did apprehend someone in an area where many of our students have to walk home. And so, you can just imagine the anxiety that that created for our scholars and families.&#8221; <strong>What are you hearing from families? Federal law states that children have a right to a public education regardless of their immigration status. I assume that&#8217;s not reassuring to the families who are keeping their kids at home.</strong> “Right. Agree. We first sent out some guidance and protocols to our schools back in January of 2025. And since then and within the last couple of months, we&#8217;ve been having small sessions with parents, in particular Hispanic, Latino families, just sharing with them and reassuring them that we&#8217;re doing all we can to keep our students safe and reassure them of the protocols we have in place and resources that they may need. “From what we&#8217;re currently hearing from our families this week is that they know once the students are with us that they&#8217;re safe. It is the route to school, whether they&#8217;re walking their kids to school or walking them to the bus stop. So, it&#8217;s the to and from school that they&#8217;re concerned about. And so, as a result, they, as I mentioned, know they&#8217;re just keeping their kids at home.” <strong>We should say that about 35% of your students are Latino and there are many people in your community in Durham, also across the country, who see this crackdown on immigration is the right thing to do. What&#8217;s your message to them as a school administrator?</strong> “As a school administrator, as an educator over close to 25 years now, our primary role and goal is to provide a world-class education for all of our scholars. &#8220;And so when you think about a student entering a classroom, ready to engage in learning about two digit multiplication or learning the Pythagorean theorem or the parts of the sail, it&#8217;s very difficult for them to focus on that lesson if they&#8217;re concerned about, &#8216;Will, I see my parents when I get home&#8217; or &#8216;On my route from school or to school, will something happen to me?&#8217; &#8220;And so it&#8217;s impacting us in a major way from the standpoint of having our students fully engaged in the lesson, first of all, fully present, but then secondly, fully engaged in the lesson because of the psychological impact it&#8217;s having on them as well as their families.&#8221; ____ <em><a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/will-walkey\">Will Walkey</a> produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/catherine-welch\">Catherine Welch</a>. <a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/michael-scotto\">Michael Scotto</a> adapted it for the web.</em> This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/11/21/immigration-schools\">WBUR.org.</a><img src=\"https://pixel.wbur.org/1055602\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;\" />",

Since then, WGLT has balanced its budget, expanding its staff of local journalists, dramatically increased online readership, launched a daily news podcast, created a paid internship program, assumed oversight of Illinois State's student news website (<em>The Vidette</em>), moved into new studios, and picked up dozens of honors for its journalism — including two regional Overall Excellence Murrows. In 2019, WGLT and Illinois State entered into an agreement with Bradley University to manage day-to-day operations of WCBU, Peoria's NPR station —a first of its kind partnership between public and private universities. Since then, WCBU has stabilized financially and has twice won small market Radio Station of the Year honors from the Illinois News Broadcasters Association. McBride never quite gave up on his childhood dream to be the next Vin Scully. He's the TV play-by-play voice for Illinois State women's basketball on ESPN+, was previously the radio voice of the women's basketball Redbirds, and did play-by-play of men's and women's basketball, baseball, and softball for the Missouri Valley Conference for 20 years.",

    "title": "Can vaping help wean people off cigarettes? Anti-smoking advocates are sharply split",
    "text": "To vape or not to vape? That is the question sparking a heated debate this week in Geneva where over 1,400 delegates have gathered to discuss the World Health Organization's tobacco control treaty and what they call \"the tobacco epidemic.\" For years, there have been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/788597890/new-study-offers-first-evidence-of-vapings-long-term-risks\" target=\"_blank\"><u>stories</u></a> warning about the dangers of vapes, also known as e-cigarettes, and other non-cigarette products like heated tobacco and nicotine pouches. Many scientists and public health experts point out that the tobacco industry promotes and profits from these newer products and that many young non-smokers are using e-cigarettes and becoming addicted to nicotine. However, a number of doctors, scientists and public health experts argue that, while these products are dangerous, they may not be as dangerous as traditional cigarettes, which <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco\" target=\"_blank\"><u>kill up to half</u></a> of long-term users. As the lesser of two evils, their argument goes, e-cigarettes could be useful in helping people quit smoking. This matters because even though smoking rates have been dropping, 1.2 billion people worldwide continue to use tobacco. About 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries. Accusations of industry influence and scientific censorship are flying. WHO staked out its stance on the issue this month in a strongly worded <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction\" target=\"_blank\"><u>position paper</u></a><u>,</u> slamming the idea of using e-cigarettes as a tool in smoking cessation. And at the anti-tobacco gathering in Geneva, leaders are calling for tough new restrictions on products like vapes. Both sides agree that getting this question right now is key to addressing the tobacco epidemic. <h3><strong>\"Mea culpa!\"</strong></h3> Twenty years ago, Dr. Derek Yach was well regarded in the public health world. The South African physician played a leading role in drafting and launching WHO's landmark tobacco treaty. And the treaty has played a critical role in reducing tobacco use, which has dropped by a third largely due to strategies like health warnings, taxation and bans on advertising. But now? Yach acknowledges he's a pariah to many former colleagues. \"I'm excommunicated,\" he says. That's because of his stance on e-cigarettes, heated tobacco and the like. Yach has come to believe that the traditional approach to smoking cessation is insufficient. \"There was only one message allowed and still is today: The only way to get rid of smoking is to get everybody to quit,\" he says, arguing that this approach doesn't \"recognize the toughness that people go through with a complex addiction, which is driven by nicotine.\" In many other areas of medicine, the idea of \"harm reduction\" is well established. For example, public health programs provide sterile needles to drug users so they don't spread HIV and hepatitis. It reduces the harm, even if it doesn't solve the addiction. Yach sees e-cigarettes as a method of harm reduction. While products like e-cigarettes still have nicotine, it is not burned. Instead, a heating element converts a nicotine liquid into a vapor that is inhaled. \"It's in the process of burning that you create the cancer-causing agents and many of the other toxins that eventually cause the death and disease,\" he says. Yach wants to see these products promoted by doctors and health programs as a way to help current smokers cut back on smoking or quit altogether. He remembers thinking to himself: \"Mea culpa! I've missed what is probably the greatest opportunity to save lives.\" Yach eventually led the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, to advocate for this approach. It's since been renamed Global Action to End Smoking and is under new leadership. There's an important point to note about this group. When Yach was at the helm, the tobacco industry funded it. It is no long accepting additional funds from Philip Morris International but that connection cemented his self-described excommunication. But Yach is not a lone voice. <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/using-e-cigarettes-to-stop-smoking/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>The U.K</u></a>.'s National Health Service, for example, has embraced e-cigarettes as a way to help people stop smoking. And a number of academics — independent of the tobacco industry — have come to agree with him. Mike Cummings, a professor and researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina, is one of them. Cummings does not want non-smokers to use e-cigarettes or the other products — but he also stresses that \"for somebody who is already addicted to nicotine in cigarettes, having an alternative that would be safer, like an e-cigarette, is something that's worth considering.\" Because of his call for a debate, Cummings says, he's been shunned by many in the world of tobacco control. He says the fact that he's testified against tobacco companies in court more than 200 times hasn't saved him from being on the outs. \"One of the ways they have attacked us is to claim that we're shills for the cigarette companies, which is absurd. We're not,\" Cummings says. \"Many of us are legitimate scientists.\" He says an open debate hasn't happened yet — and that it can be hard to get funding for research into smoking harm reduction strategies. \"That's not science. That's anti-science. It's censorship,\" he says. One of the largest tobacco companies, Phillip Morris International, declined an interview request from NPR but said in a statement that WHO shouldn't fear dialogue and is out of step with governments that are embracing smoke-free products in order to end smoking. <h3><strong>\"Mass marketing harmful products\"</strong></h3> When it comes to the idea of harm reduction, WHO is adamant in its opposition. Its <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction\" target=\"_blank\"><u>position paper</u></a> says the tobacco industry is \"misappropriating\" the medical term harm reduction and \"mass marketing harmful products\" while \"cloaking\" it in medical language. \"Let's be clear, the companies that make these products are not motivated by harm reduction or health, they are motivated by one thing and one thing only: generating profit,\" says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"There is no evidence of their net benefit for public health, but mounting evidence of their harm.\" One major concern in this debate is that the products are often used by non-smokers — especially young ones who are attracted by the flavors and packaging. \"We see use rates [of e-cigarettes] among children nine times higher than among adults,\" says Benn McGrady. He heads Public Health Law and Policies at WHO, which helps governments develop and defend tobacco laws. \"The latest data that we have shows there are 15 million children worldwide using e-cigarettes.\" McGrady worries that, without proper regulations, there could be a generation of people newly addicted to nicotine. WHO argues that countries need to regulate the products at least as strictly as cigarettes. Last month, the International Pediatric Association also came out forcefully against e-cigarettes, warning in the medical journal <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/156/5/e2025072337/204538/E-Cigarettes-and-the-Nicotine-Epidemic-Statement?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Pediatrics</u></em> that </a>\"e-cigarette use is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, oral diseases and cancer, with dual users facing greater health risks than cigarette smokers alone.\" The stakes, their position paper says, are high: \"E-cigarettes threaten to reverse decades of progress in tobacco control.\"<strong> </strong> \"That's the opposite of harm reduction, right? That's really harm-causing,\" says <a href=\"https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stella.bialous\" target=\"_blank\">Stella Bialous</a>, the associate director for Global Tobacco Control Initiatives at the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. One concern that's surfaced has been <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/07/16/disposable-e-cigarettes-study\" target=\"_blank\"><u>exposure to metals</u></a> — like lead — in the heating element of the e-cigarette. However, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41254430/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>studies</u></a> have pointed in both <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38411454/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>directions</u></a>. When it comes to exactly how risky these new products are, McGrady says, there's huge variation between the various products and it's \"not responsible\" to generalize. These products are relatively new and WHO's report acknowledges their risks will only become clear over time. <h3><strong>\"An unutterable scam\"</strong></h3> For some, this debate feels like déjà vu — and a classic example of the tobacco industry interfering in public health efforts and sowing division. Bialous says many researchers believe that this debate is \"actually one of the strategies that a tobacco company developed to divide and conquer — like 'let's talk about harm reduction and get all the people fighting among themselves while we continue to sell the products.'\" Dr. Tim McAfee is the former head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health — which has now been eliminated by President Trump. He says this current battle reminds him of when the industry promoted filtered cigarettes as safer in the 1950s and when they pushed low-tar cigarettes in the '60s and '70s. \"Every single one of those things they've done over the last 100 years has turned out to be an unutterable scam,\" he says. He calls the effort to promote e-cigarettes and similar products a smokescreen.<strong> </strong> Cummings, the professor at Medical University of South Carolina, counters that just because these newer products are backed by the tobacco industry doesn't automatically mean they can't play a role in smoking reduction. \"We ought to get the evidence and weigh it and debate it — and help guide the policies based on evidence, not on ideology,\" he adds.",

    "text": "One year later and we're back in Oz this weekend. If you grew tired of waiting, there are more options: a Brendan Fraser-led dramedy, a stirring Marathi-language love story and a documentary <em>about </em>a documentary. <h3><strong>Wicked: For Good </strong></h3> <em>In theaters Friday</em> The yellow brick road is under construction as we rejoin our favorite green and pink Ozian witches. Elphaba, exiled after defying both gravity and the fraud who calls himself a Wizard, is creating as much havoc as she can with just a broom. Glinda, meanwhile, is spreading Wizardly propaganda and \"obsessulating\" over the motorized pink bubble she's been given to make her appear magical. They both have issues with the blowhard Wizard, who is pushing fake news, and is also, let's say, dictatorious, or maybe, fascistified. Things are darker in Oz this time. If you've somehow missed the backstory to this backstory,<em> Wicked</em> — first a novel, then a Broadway musical — was conceived as a prequel for adults to the events depicted in <em>The Wizard of Oz.</em> It was nothing if not complicated, both morally and plot-wise — origin stories for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow were mostly brushed in after the central witch frenemies were well established. But that meant filmmaker Jon M. Chu had a problem when the Broadway hit became <em>two</em> movies. The story's early part about growing up has songs that are popular, gravity-defying. The later part, though, is about wising up — about consequences, the politics of oppression. It kinda doesn't sing. So for this movie, Stephen Schwartz wrote a new tune for Ariana Grande about Glinda's life in a bubble — and for Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba, he penned a musical nod to the original Wizard of Oz called \"No Place Like Home.\" And they're fine — fabulously sung, even if they seem just as aimed at original-song Oscar nominations as at filling plot holes. They just can't make this prequel-sequel feel any less dutiful or by the numbers — rehashing bits of the 1939 movie classic, shoehorning in animals who no longer talk, when all you really want is that song that gives <em>Wicked: For Good</em> its title. After way too long, the song arrives — powerhouse voices singing about friendship and doing good when good is hard. And for fans, that might make the long, five-hour, <em>two</em>-movie trek feel worth it. Not for me. I was hoping for at least entrancillating. <h3><strong>Rental Family</strong></h3> <em>In theaters Friday</em> In director Hikari's sentimental dramedy, Brendan Fraser plays Phillip, an American actor in Tokyo who lands an unusual gig with a Japanese \"rental family\" agency — playing stand-in roles in the lives of strangers. His disorienting first assignment is \"sad white guy\" at a funeral, where he's startled to see the \"corpse\" sit up in his coffin to watch himself being mourned. Phillip's better prepared when he's hired to play the groom in a sham marriage that will free a young woman from her restrictive family. After initial trepidation, he celebrates the success of the ruse by spending the night with a sex worker (presumably for the benefit of audience members unaware that transactional relationships are time-honored). In longer-term engagements — playing an inquisitive journalist so a movie star with dementia will feel he's still remembered, and playing dad to a vulnerable 11-year-old girl — he gets emotionally involved with the folks he's deceiving, and they with him. Phillip's eyes well with tears as the manipulative nature of his relationships become problematic, but the filmmaker isn't nearly as interested in exploring the ramifications as he is in manipulating us. <h3><strong>Cactus Pears (Sabar Bonda)</strong></h3> <em>In limited theaters starting Friday</em> Anand is a 30-something gay city dweller who's been caring for his dying father in Delhi, and who dreads traveling with his mother to their ancestral home in the countryside for ten days of ritual mourning. But once there, Anand reconnects with a childhood friend, also gay, and the two bond over their shared difficulties with families who want to know why they've not taken brides and settled down. Loosely based on filmmaker Rohan Parashuram Kanawade's own experience when his father died, the Marathi-language film offers a laconic but decently stirring portrait of men who struggle with lower-caste social restraints and familial obligations, and who ultimately find solace in each other. <h3><strong>Zodiac Killer Project</strong></h3> <em>In limited theaters starting Friday </em> With financing and contract negotiations underway, Charlie Shackleton was already scouting locations and storyboarding a documentary when he learned he was being denied the rights to retired California patrolman Lyndon Lafferty's book <em>The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up</em>. Having gone that far, he couldn't bear to let it go, so he made a film about the film he <em>would have made</em>, and ends up sending up the whole true crime documentary genre in the process. Wry, precise, earnest, bemused, the filmmaker is forthright about the evocative but manipulative clichés he's employing — cigarette butt-filled ashtrays, reenactments filmed in soft focus from behind, the swinging interrogation light (\"why is it always swinging\"). He also points out the shortcuts he's taking (\"this is actually a library, not a police station\"). The resulting film is amusing, pointed, and gets to the very heart of what makes these documentaries so compelling.",

    "text": "As the U.S. continues to face its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health\" target=\"_blank\"><u>worst</u></a> measles outbreak in three decades, another country that has struggled with measles offers a telling case study: the eastern European nation of Romania. While most countries hardest hit by measles are lower-income countries in the Global South, wealthier countries have also seen significant outbreaks. Romania is one of them. The country ranked <a href=\"https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&YEAR=\" target=\"_blank\"><u>fifth</u></a> on the measles outbreak list last year, reporting 30,692 cases and <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/MEAS-AER-2024-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>23 deaths</u></a>. According to Dr. Aurora Stanescu, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Public Health in Romania, five of those deaths were children under age 1. Nina Schwalbe, a senior scholar at the Georgetown Center for Health Policy and Politics, calls those figures a \"wake-up call.\" \"That's a lot of cases of measles, and that's a lot of deaths from a disease that really shouldn't be killing anybody at this point,\" Schwalbe says. Unlike many lower-resource countries where measles <a href=\"https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&YEAR=\" target=\"_blank\"><u>takes a toll</u></a> — such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen — Romania is an upper-middle-income country and part of the European Union. Even now, the consequences of low vaccine rates linger. The country <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/06/03/measles-in-europe-where-are-cases-of-one-of-the-most-contagious-diseases-rising\" target=\"_blank\"><u>continues</u></a> to report measles cases in 2025. However, initial tallies are significantly lower than those of last year. According to public health specialists in Romania, the current numbers reflect how measles <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/v17060755\" target=\"_blank\"><u>tends</u></a> to come in waves. Amid a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/1231104444/the-anti-vaccine-movement\" target=\"_blank\"><u>growing trend</u></a> of vaccine hesitancy around the world, Romania's experience paints a cautionary tale. <h3><strong>An authoritarian past</strong></h3> \"The outbreaks aren't only a matter of poverty and not understanding the importance of immunization,\" says Dr. Mihai Craiu, a pediatrician at Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Romania. \"It's multifactorial.\" One of the forces driving the measles surge is Romania's political transition. Under the repressive Communist government that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/12/24/369593135/25-years-after-death-a-dictator-still-casts-a-shadow-in-romania\" target=\"_blank\"><u>ruled</u></a> for more than four decades, vaccines for childhood diseases were required. Immunizations were <a href=\"https://romania.europalibera.org/a/doctor-mihai-craiu-fake-news-medicina-vaccinare-stiinta-dezinformare/33569279.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>given</u></a> to kids at school without parental consent, Craiu says. \"Virtually all children were immunized,\" he recalls. \"Prevention of infectious diseases by vaccination were ideal terrains in which the Communist state could demonstrate its power and legitimate its authority,\" historian Dora Vargha <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.7765/9781526110916.00010/html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>wrote</u></a> in a book about vaccines. \"If vaccination worked, the result would be immediate and visible.\" The measles vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><u>introduced</u></a> in 1979. The result: a 90% reduction in cases, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><u>according</u></a> to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And an immunization rate above 95%. That's the magic number for measles. \"If 95% of people are vaccinated, the measles virus can't find a home for itself in those people, and eventually it gives up,\" Schwalbe says. Then came political — and vaccine — upheaval. When Romania <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/1999/11/05/1066228/the-collapse-of-communism\" target=\"_blank\"><u>adopted</u></a> a democratic form of government in 1989, citizens gained more freedom — including the ability to decline the recommended but no longer mandatory vaccine.<strong> </strong> Like others in post-Communist countries, Romanians <a href=\"https://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/content/articles/symposium2010/participant-papers/Simona_Vasilache_-_Romania.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\"><u>grew</u></a> more distrustful of their government — and the immunizations it was recommending. This laid the foundation for anti-vaccine groups to step in and take advantage of the public mindset. \"Part of the perception of democracy in Romania was the liberty of not obeying the rules,\" Craiu says, noting that some Romanians view immunization as a form of Communist-era state control. When Romanians refuse vaccines, he says it's their way of asserting independence after decades of authoritarian leadership. <h3><strong>The impact of an HPV vaccine campaign</strong></h3> But vaccine refusal wasn't just about asserting personal freedom. People began doubting the benefits of vaccines. \"This decline [in vaccination] is partly due to decreased public confidence in vaccination benefits, reflected in parental refusal to vaccinate their children,\" <a href=\"https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>read</u></a> a report published in October by Romania's National Institute for Public Health — their equivalent of the CDC. This trend was exacerbated by growing skepticism about vaccines, exacerbated by the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12013266\" target=\"_blank\"><u>2008 campaign</u></a> to vaccinate girls against HPV, the virus that can <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5323229/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rfk\" target=\"_blank\"><u>cause</u></a> cervical cancer. That campaign deepened public skepticism about all vaccines, as <a href=\"https://rtsa.ro/tras/index.php/tras/article/view/195/191\" target=\"_blank\"><u>headlines</u></a> from various Romanian media outlets demonstrate. At the time of the HPV vaccine rollout, measles vaccine coverage stood at the recommended 95% rate. In subsequent years, it declined steadily, <a href=\"https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/wuenic-trends/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>dropping</u></a> by 20 percentage points by 2017 and further declining to just 62% in 2023. A study conducted by Stanescu and her colleagues last year <a href=\"https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-rezultatelor-estimarii-acoperirii-vaccinale-cu-2-doze-rro-la-5-ani-si-cu-1-doza-dtpa-la-14-ani_februarie-2024/?wpdmdl=127363&refresh=68f9bc5de5a3c1761197149\" target=\"_blank\"><u>found</u></a> that only one of Romania's more than 40 regions had measles vaccine coverage above 95%. The pandemic exacerbated that sharp nosedive in vaccine coverage, the National Institute for Public Health report observes, noting disruptions in routine vaccination. As the share of those protected against measles decreased, <a href=\"https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=ROU&YEAR=\" target=\"_blank\"><u>outbreaks</u></a> pummeled the country. \"Some saw the outbreaks in the 2010s as a wake-up call, but others didn't,\" says Dr. Gindrovel Dumitra, the vice president of the Romanian National Society of Family Medicine. \"Some people simply refuse vaccines — and even an outbreak won't convince them.\" <h3><strong>A health system struggles to keep up</strong></h3> Along with Romania's growing anti-vaccine movement, the country faces systemic barriers that contribute to its low vaccination rates. Dumitra points to three main factors: a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/21/romanias-health-care-system-the-eus-worst-struggles-to-reform\" target=\"_blank\"><u>fragile health system</u></a> that remains one of the most <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Healthcare_expenditure_statistics_-_overview\" target=\"_blank\"><u>underfunded</u></a> in Europe, a <a href=\"https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-025-00985-6\" target=\"_blank\"><u>shrinking</u></a> number of primary care providers — driven by burnout and low compensation —<strong> </strong>and the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11598722/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>absence</u></a> of mandatory immunization policies. Lack of funding for health care <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/27-08-2025-new-study-exposes-barriers-to-childhood-vaccination-in-romanian-communities\" target=\"_blank\"><u>disproportionately affects</u></a> minority groups like the country's <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/roma-eu/roma-equality-inclusion-and-participation-eu-country/romania_en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>nearly</u></a> 2 million Roma people. Minorities are often blamed for low vaccination rates, but Craiu says a deeper look reveals that the problem stems from inadequate outreach and lack of access to care. \"If you don't have a family doctor in your village, then first of all, it's difficult to get information and then it's also difficult to access vaccines,\" says Dr. Silvia Gatscher, the health operations manager at the World Health Organization Country Office in Romania. As the years passed, the clergy <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/vaccines-carry-tiny-knives-cut-veins-inside-romanias-toxic-anti/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>became</u></a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-024-20133-4\" target=\"_blank\"><u>influential</u></a> in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/romania-president-election-simion-trump.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>advocating</u></a> against vaccines — some say as a reaction to the government <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/21567689.2022.2080669\" target=\"_blank\"><u>limiting</u></a> church services during the early years of the pandemic. Simultaneously, far-right politicians <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/romanias-elections-a-victory-for-medical-populism/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>capitalized</u></a> on growing mistrust toward vaccines. One of those anti-vaccine lawmakers is Diana Sosoaca. She said, \"God is not vaccinated\" during a <a href=\"https://spotmedia.ro/en/news/politics/romanian-mep-sosoaca-anti-vaccine-circus-in-the-european-parliament-until-her-microphone-was-cut-off-god-is-not-vaccinated-in-romania-88-are-not-vaccinated\" target=\"_blank\"><u>brief speech</u></a> on the floor of the European Parliament last year. <h3><strong>A free fall in immunization coverage</strong></h3> Currently, only two-thirds of Romanians are fully vaccinated against measles. That's the <a href=\"https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-vaccination-coverage?GROUP=Countries&ANTIGEN=MCV2&YEAR=&CODE=\" target=\"_blank\"><u>lowest</u></a> measles vaccination rate in the European Union. The shortfall has serious consequences. Researchers <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.1787\" target=\"_blank\"><u>estimate</u></a> that one person who contracts the virus can infect up to 18 unvaccinated people nearby. The risk is especially dire for children too young to have completed the two-dose vaccination protocol, which is <a href=\"https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=170&IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&IncludeAdultAgeGroup=true&IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false\" target=\"_blank\"><u>administered</u></a> first at 12 months and then again at age 5. That includes babies like Ionela Radulescu's son. Last year, the 7-month-old was hospitalized for pneumonia and came into contact with a child infected with measles. \"He had a rash on his face. It was pinkish and very small,\" the 31-year-old mother says through an interpreter. \"Then it started going down onto his chest and palms. It even went down to the soles of his feet. He had it everywhere.\" Radulescu lives in Suceava, in northern Romania. Last year, the area <a href=\"https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>recorded</u></a> the sixth-highest rate of measles cases among more than 40 regions. The frequency of cases in Suceava <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaf167\" target=\"_blank\"><u>mirrored</u></a> levels seen in countries before the measles vaccine became widely available. Although her son was too young to be vaccinated, the mother says: \"I felt bad. It was very hard. I started questioning myself and asking questions like, Was I too negligent? Was I not careful enough? You start to blame yourself. It's a really ugly feeling.\" And measles can be far more than an uncomfortable rash. The virus can <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516\" target=\"_blank\"><u>lead to</u></a> pneumonia, eye inflammation, diarrhea and ear infections, which can result in deafness in approximately 5 to 10% of cases. Even after recovering from the illness, children remain at risk for a rare and fatal complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It typically <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>appears</u></a> about seven to 10 years after the initial infection. Stanescu estimates there have been about a dozen cases in Romania in recent years. \"Just because you're OK from that infection at the time doesn't mean that that infection doesn't have very serious consequences for you later in life,\" Schwalbe explains. <h3><strong>A different way to talk to parents</strong></h3> While Craiu and Dumitra admit it's an uphill battle, they've taken an evidence-based approach to combating misinformation and encouraging vaccination. \"It's a huge difference in what we learned in medical school and what I'm doing now,\" Craiu explains. When speaking with parents, Dumitra <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s500640\" target=\"_blank\"><u>uses motivational interviewing</u></a>, a technique that helps patients adopt changes when they decide the change matters to them — not because a doctor said so. It also encourages physicians to listen without judgment, exploring a patient's ambivalence. The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-065483\" target=\"_blank\"><u>American Academy of Pediatrics praises the method</u></a> as an effective way to improve communication about vaccines. \"Yesterday, when I recommended a woman to be vaccinated against the flu, she told me, 'I'm scared of the vaccine.' I asked her, 'Why?'\" Dumitra recalls. The woman explained she was worried the vaccine would worsen a chronic illness. \"After acknowledging her concerns, I offered her information and then verified if she understood it. She eventually got vaccinated.\" <h3><strong>Lessons from Romania's outbreaks</strong></h3> Gatscher is optimistic that evidence-based approaches to vaccine hesitancy will chip away at the mistrust and misinformation surrounding vaccines in her country. Yet the global measles count this year indicates that other relatively well-off countries aren't drawing any lessons from Romania. This month, Canada <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>lost</u></a> its measles elimination status due to sustained transmission, <a href=\"https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>with</u></a> 5,000 cases so far this year. The U.S. has confirmed <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>1,723 cases</u></a> in 2025 so far, according to the CDC — the highest annual number <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health\" target=\"_blank\"><u>in more than three decades</u></a>. While the U.S. has much to learn from what has happened in Romania, Schwalbe says America exists in its \"own bubble\" and often looks away from examples like Romania. \"I think we are incredibly good in America at thinking, 'That's what's happening over there, and it has nothing to do with us,'\" Schwalbe says. \"I don't think that Romania will teach us any lessons, unfortunately, even though it's such a clear lesson. The lesson to everybody — all over the world — is that when you lose high coverage of [vaccination against] measles, the disease comes back.\" <em>Michal Ruprecht is a Stanford Global Health Media Fellow.</em><br>",

This message <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615040/cdc-rfk-childhood-vaccines-autism\" target=\"_blank\">aligns with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s opinion</a> that vaccines are dangerous. <ul><li>🎧<strong> CDC scientists say they didn't change their website</strong>, and the Department of Health and Human Services wouldn't divulge who ordered the adjustment to the wording, NPR's Pien Huang tells <em>Up First</em>. There is <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x\" target=\"_blank\">no new scientific evidence to support the claim</a> of a link between vaccines and autism. Huang notes that it is interesting that a headline on the CDC's webpage still states that vaccines don't cause autism. However, there is an asterisk next to this statement, which explains that the agency will not remove it due to an agreement with Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who provided a key confirmation vote for Kennedy to become the HHS secretary.</li></ul> <strong>President Trump's chief negotiator has presented a new 28-point plan for peace to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</strong> International observers are encouraged that Trump has not given up on peace between Ukraine and Russia, but the proposal requires major territorial concessions from Ukraine, which the country has repeatedly rejected. <br> <ul><li>🎧 <strong>The Trump administration continues to suggest these concessions because the president is focused on getting a yes to his plan</strong>, says NPR's Franco Ordoñez. Russian analyst Sam Charap notes that for Trump, the details don't matter as much. He simply wants the fighting to come to an end, unlike the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, who are <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x\" target=\"_blank\">more focused on the details</a>. Russia desires more strategic territory, while Ukraine has been adamant on security guarantees from Washington and its Western allies to ensure this type of invasion doesn't happen again.</li></ul> <strong>Trump will meet with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House's Oval Office today. </strong>This will mark the first time the two will meet face-to-face. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, emerged as a national figure after his primary win earlier this year. The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5615169/trump-mamdani-oval-office-communist-socialist\" target=\"_blank\">president has called Mamdani a \"communist\"</a> on social media and repeatedly sought to paint him as too radical for the city that elected him mayor. <br> <ul><li>🎧 <strong>The meeting is a reminder of the shift Mamdani has to make as he steps into the new role</strong>, says NPR's Elena Moore. The mayor-elect has a background as an activist, but today will be a <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x\" target=\"_blank\">test for him in balancing his policy priorities</a> and maintaining political diplomacy. As a reminder, Moore says, the president vowed to cut New York's federal funding if Mamdani won the election, so the meeting comes with real stakes.</li></ul> <strong>State and local voting officials from both major political parties are actively preparing for the possibility of the Trump administration's interference</strong> in the midterm elections, which are less than a year away. The president has consistently spread false claims about voting in the U.S. In the spring, he issued an executive order aimed at imposing significant changes to election systems. Although courts have largely blocked the order, he has hinted at the possibility of taking other executive action as well. The election community is concerned that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year.

The team focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect. \"The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center,\" Yacawych says. \"It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response.\" The second area monitors food intake and tells people when they're full. The team found a way to direct GLP-1 to the area involved in feeling full, while keeping the drug out of the vomit center. When the researchers did this, the mice no longer felt sick. But they also didn't get thin — probably because there are specific cells in the vomit center that do not induce vomiting but are critical to weight loss. \"So it's very challenging,\" Yacawych says, \"to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss.\" A possible workaround came from a team led by <a href=\"https://endocrinology.uw.edu/people/faculty/blevins-j\" target=\"_blank\">Ernie Blevins</a> of the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/01/28/1152313319/a-new-study-casts-doubt-on-oxytocins-role-as-a-love-hormone\" target=\"_blank\">oxytocin</a>, which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick. <h3>Not just nausea</h3> Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst, which could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea. \"If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, that would be a problem,\" says <a href=\"https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/faculty-directory/DerekDaniels.html\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Daniels</a> of the University at Buffalo. To understand how GLP-1 drugs reduce thirst, Daniels and a team began studying the brains of rats. And they got lucky. \"We had a happy accident in the lab,\" Daniels says. \"And the happy accident involved a rat called the <a href=\"https://www.eneuro.org/content/3/2/ENEURO.0150-15.2016\" target=\"_blank\">Brattleboro rat</a>.\" Brattleboro rats are laboratory rodents with a genetic mutation that makes them thirsty nearly all the time. But the scientists discovered that these rats are also very sensitive to GLP-1 drugs, which drastically reduced their water consumption. The team studied the rats' brains to see where GLP-1 was influencing thirst. That led them to several areas of the brain that appear to affect thirst but not appetite. The discovery could help scientists preserve thirst by designing drugs that \"target good places but not bad places,\" Daniels says. <h3>Appetite and addiction</h3> A team from the University of Virginia found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a brain area that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a region involved in emotion and the reward system. When the researchers delivered GLP-1 to this brain area in mice, it reduced their desire for \"rewarding food, like a burger,\" says <a href=\"https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/ali-d-guler\" target=\"_blank\">Ali D. Güler</a> of the University of Virginia. But the animals continued to eat healthy, nonrewarding foods, he says — a bit like people choosing a salad bar over dessert. Identifying this brain area should help scientists find GLP-1 drugs that target the reward system while avoiding areas involved in appetite, Güler says. And that could lead to new treatments for alcoholism and other substance use disorders. The finding also could explain the observation that people who take GLP-1 agonists tend to reduce their consumption of alcohol.",

    "title": "Artists respond to a cultural squeeze during the 'Fall of Freedom'",
    "text": "On Friday and Saturday, artists across the country are participating in <a href=\"https://www.falloffreedom.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Fall of Freedom</u></a> — an undertaking which they say represents creative resistance to authoritarianism. More than 600 events of all sizes have been announced across more than 40 states, from Alaska to Florida. \"I think the reality is that both artists and institutions right now are feeling this fear, and we're feeling unmoored about what we are supposed to do. And the fear, I think, of being silenced starts right here, starts in our heads,\" said Eric Gottesman, a visual artist based in Washington, D.C. He is also co-executive director of <a href=\"https://www.forfreedoms.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>For Freedoms</u></a>, an arts organization that promotes civic engagement. Gottesman and other artists around the nation say that many of their peers at cultural institutions are feeling scared and isolated, following <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/03/nx-s1-5385888/sweeping-cuts-hit-nea-after-trump-administration-calls-to-eliminate-the-agency\" target=\"_blank\"><u>sweeping grant cuts</u></a> at the National Endowment for the Arts, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/21/nx-s1-5510039/kennedy-center-dance-programming\" target=\"_blank\"><u>firings of programming staff</u></a> at the Kennedy Center and an executive order from President Trump requiring an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/12/nx-s1-5500550/smithsonian-trump-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>audit of Smithsonian museums</u></a>. In August, Trump posted on social media that museums all over the country are \"the last remaining segment of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/19/nx-s1-5507221/trump-smithsonian-museums-woke\" target=\"_blank\"><u>WOKE</u></a>.\" Gottesman added that many large cultural institutions seem to be stuck. \"I think in this moment, when arts institutions are paralyzed by the real fear of suppression and retribution for ideas that seem critical to the kind of freedom that democracy promises, they're not able to support artists in the way that artists usually expect arts institutions to provide support . . .and so this creates a gap.\" That's where Fall of Freedom is stepping in. Two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/01/14/1072902297/two-time-pulitzer-winner-lynn-nottage-turns-a-triple-play-in-new-york-city\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Lynn Nottage</u></a>, one of the organizers, said she is already seeing cultural institutions decline to program work that may be targeted as controversial or politically out of step. \"What we've encountered with regard to large museums is that they feel very fearful of retribution from the government,\" she said. \"There are more nos than yeses because of anticipatory obedience. Artists aren't afraid, but the institutions are afraid, and they are beginning to make decisions based on their fear of losing grants and losing their major donors. And that trickles down to the artists who are beginning to lose opportunities. As a result, exhibitions are being canceled. Plays are not being programmed.\" The idea for Fall of Freedom originated with visual artist Dread Scott, who approached her with an idea for \"an artistic action.\" Nottage said it was a lifeline. She said she had been feeling \"very paralyzed by how quickly things were shifting in this country. I knew I wanted to respond to the rising tide of fascism, but wasn't sure how. And then when he asked me to be part of Fall of Freedom, I thought, 'Yes, this is a beautiful organizing principle.'\" Scott's idea was to give artists an open-ended framework in which to use their creativity to speak to this moment. \"Part of what we're doing is trying to change the dynamic where these individual institutions are trying to make decisions for their own individual survival and trying to figure out how to sort of continue to make work under fascism,\" Scott said. \"And we're trying to say, 'No, actually, let's all stand up. They might be able to pick one or two of us off, but they can't get us all if we all collectively stand together.'\" Scott observed that art has always been a catalyst in social movements and political protests. \"I tell people that, you know, what would the civil rights movement have looked like without Billie Holiday doing '<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/12/30/168292529/the-strange-story-of-the-man-behind-strange-fruit\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Strange Fruit'</u></a>? Or what would the resistance to fascism have looked like without Picasso painting <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/no/podcast/picassos-guernica/id463700760?i=1000394334146\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Guernica</u></a>?\" He added, \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15394716/the-clash\" target=\"_blank\"><u>The Clash</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/28/1184748176/a-look-back-at-public-enemys-it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-back\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Public Enemy</u></a> were deeply meaningful to me as a young art student trying to make my way in a world that I could see that was really terrible. …. Those musicians gave me license to say, 'No, the world is what's crazy, not you.'\" Fall of Freedom came about quickly, which Chicago-based artist and activist <a href=\"https://jennykendler.com/home.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Jenny Kendler</u></a> says she appreciated. \"You see how long it can take to develop cultural programs,\" she said. \"If I'm doing a museum show, we're planning it two years out. But we don't have that amount of time right now. We need to be responsive to this moment.\" Along with Scott and Nottage, other marquee names participating include musician John Legend, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, choreographer Bill T. Jones, and author Ann Patchett. Communities can also participate in zine making in Homer, Alaska, see a performance of the musical <em>Les Miserables</em> in Portland, Maine, and go to a dance party in Cheyenne, Wyo. <a href=\"https://www.moscowcontemporary.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Moscow Contemporary</u></a>, an arts organization in Moscow, Idaho – a city of about 27,000 people — is planning two days of events, including a roundtable discussion on civil disobedience and an open mic night. Roger Rowley, Moscow Contemporary's executive director, said he's thinking of this as just the start of a creative movement. He said you can think of the \"fall\" in the name Fall of Freedom as a decline – or as part of a cycle, or season. \"This is the <em>fall</em> of freedom,\" he said. \"And it's quite likely a winter of freedom that we're going to have to continue to struggle through. But we'll get to a spring of freedom and a summer of freedom on the other side. You put in the energy now, and you reap the rewards later.\"<br> <em>This story was edited  for air and digital by Jennifer Vanasco.</em>",

    "text": "BANGKOK — Police have arrested a suspected Russian hacker on the Thai resort island of Phuket who was wanted by the FBI on allegations he was behind cyberattacks on U.S. and European government agencies, officials said. The 35-year-old, who entered Thailand on Oct. 30 at Phuket Airport, was taken into custody earlier this month at his hotel and is now being held pending possible extradition, Thai police said. The suspect's name was not released but Russian state-run news agency Russia Today identified him as Denis Obrezko, a native of Stavropol. It reported that his relatives confirmed the Nov. 6 arrest and were planning to fight his extradition to the United States. In an e-mail Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice refused to comment on the possible extradition or give other details. The U.S. State Department and American officials in Thailand also refused to comment. The Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian embassy in Thailand also did not respond to requests for comment, but Russia's consul general in Phuket, Yegor Ivanov, told Russian state news agency Tass that the consulate had \"received notification of the arrest of a Russian citizen on charges of committing an information technology crime.\" \"He was arrested on November 6 and transferred to Bangkok that same day,\" Ivanov said, without providing further details. Ilya Ilyin, head of the consular section of the Russian embassy in Thailand, told Tass on Monday that Russian diplomats had visited the suspect in prison in Bangkok. \"Embassy staff conducted a consular visit to the Russian citizen detained at the request of the United States,\" Ilyin said, adding that the embassy was arranging for him to be able to meet with his relatives. Thailand's Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau said in a Nov. 12 statement that it was an FBI tip that the \"world-class hacker\" was traveling to Thailand that led to his arrest in Phuket on an international warrant. In the raid on his hotel, police seized laptop computers, mobile phones, and digital wallets, the police's statement said, adding that FBI officials were on hand for the arrest. Several media outlets reported that Aleksey Lukashev, a different 35-year-old Russian hacking suspect wanted by the FBI who has ties to Russian military intelligence, had been arrested in Phuket the following day. Thai police said, however, there had only been one arrest and the U.S. Department of Justice told the AP that Lukashev \"remains a wanted fugitive.\" The formal request for the Obrezko's extradition has been made but it was not clear how long the process would take.<br>",

    "title": "Rare earths: Federal backing and tech advances aim to help the U.S. catch up to China",
    "text": "With names like neodymium and dysprosium, rare-earth elements sound exotic — and their perceived scarcity has only added to the mystique. In reality, rare earths aren't that rare, but just difficult to extract and refine. Yet they've become indispensable to modern life, embedded in everything from our smartphones and electric-vehicle motors to wind turbines and medical imaging machines. And demand is climbing. The real choke point is processing and refining — a complex and environmentally sensitive step that the U.S. has lagged behind in and that China now dominates, controlling <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=No%20single%20country%20currently%20possesses,the%20rare%20earths%20supply%20chain.\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 90%</a> of global output. The need for high-torque, compact EV motors — which use rare-earth magnets that are three to four times stronger than conventional magnets — is helping drive demand. Production of these motors is soaring by <a href=\"https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/why-rare-earths-are-critical-to-ev-motors/#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways,EV%20motor%20market%20in%202024.\" target=\"_blank\">roughly a third each year</a>. Military aircraft also rely heavily on these elements; one <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/articles/2023/the-time-to-prevent-shortfalls-in-critical-materials.html\" target=\"_blank\">RAND</a> estimate suggests an F-35 contains over 900 pounds of rare-earth materials in its engines and electronics. <h3>Taking a private-public approach</h3> To reduce reliance on foreign supply, the White House is pursuing U.S. self-sufficiency in rare-earth production. The federal government under President Trump has supported the sector in ways that depart from traditional free-market principles. Rather than relying solely on private industry, the federal government has followed a strategy similar to China's, providing hundreds of millions in loans and even taking stakes in key mines and startups. Indiana-based ReElement Technologies is among the beneficiaries of this government backing. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced a partnership between the Pentagon, via its <a href=\"https://www.cto.mil/osc/\" target=\"_blank\">Office of Strategic Capital</a> (OSC), ReElement and Vulcan Elements, a North Carolina based firm that produces rare-earth magnets for military applications. ReElement says it has developed a more efficient, environmentally friendly method of rare-earth processing and recycling that involves chromatography. The company operates a commercialization facility in Noblesville, Ind., with a larger production site in Marion, Ind., slated to come online next year. ReElement Technologies CEO Mark Jensen says confidently that by the end of 2026, \"we'll be the largest producer of rare earth oxides in the United States.\" Because China's dominance in refining is so great, the U.S. benchmark for success is modest, according to Bert Donnes, a research analyst at investment banking firm William Blair. ReElement, in partnership with Vulcan Elements, aims in the next few years to produce 10,000 metric tons of neodymium-iron-boron magnets used not only in EVs, but also wind-turbine generators, hard-disk drives and MRI machines. Even that ambitious target is a fraction of the approximately 230,000 tons produced globally in 2024, according to the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/advanced-magnet-manufacturing-in-us\" target=\"_blank\">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a>, or IEEE. \"I would say if you see those numbers, you think this is going to be a massive facility,\" says Donnes of ReElement's current operation. \"It isn't.\" Compared to a traditional processing facility, ReElement's operation is compact, he says, helping avoid any \"not-in-my-backyard\" (NIMBY) backlash. \"So it's not like people are scared of this process. Maybe they don't know about it as much because you can keep the process so small,\" he says. <h3>How the U.S. lost its lead</h3> Starting in the 1980s, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/23/nx-s1-5475137/china-rare-earth-elements\" target=\"_blank\">China began surging ahead</a> of the U.S. and the rest of the world in rare earth production. Around the same time, environmental concerns mounted at the only major U.S. rare earth mine, Mountain Pass in California, where spills of radioactive and toxic wastewater — byproducts of refining — raised alarms. Mountain Pass is an open-cut mine where they \"drill and blast, blend their types and locations in the pit\" before grinding the solid materials into smaller particles, according to Kelton Smith, a lead process engineer for mining at Tetra Tech, a global consulting and engineering services firm. A flotation process then concentrates the rare earths that are in turn leached with hydrochloric acid. The California mine had to halt production multiple times over the years due to environmental concerns. During that time, it changed ownership and ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection before being acquired by MP Materials in 2017, which reopened the mine. The troubles at Mountain Pass helped China to gain a foothold and eventually overtake the U.S. in rare earths — just as demand for them was rising. Beijing now produces about 60% of the world's supply of these substances, according to the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/with-new-export-controls-on-critical-minerals-supply-concentration-risks-become-reality\" target=\"_blank\">International Energy Agency</a>. China also holds a substantial amount of the world's proven reserves of the ores that contain these elements — roughly 34%, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, but several other countries — including the U.S. — have substantial reserves as well. Trump's trade war with China has made the squeeze in rare earths even more acute. Because the U.S. lacks the ability to process rare earths on a large scale, MP Materials has had to send its ore from Mountain Pass to China for refining. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rare-earths-trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-effd6a7ec64b5830df9d3c76ab9b607a\" target=\"_blank\">But no more</a>. Instead, the company is having to ramp up its limited capability to process the ore on-site. Further complicating the issue are expanded <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/with-new-export-controls-on-critical-minerals-supply-concentration-risks-become-reality\" target=\"_blank\">export controls that Beijing announced last month</a> that require foreign companies to obtain a license in order to sell products overseas that contain Chinese-sourced rare earths. Aaron Mintzes is deputy policy director and counsel at Earthworks, a national group focused on preventing the adverse impacts of mineral and energy development. \"What we're urging … is to do that processing in ways that reduce energy and water intensity and toxicity,\" he says. Brent Elliott, a research associate professor of geology at the University of Texas, estimates the U.S. has sufficient resources to meet demand. \"It's about the extraction potential and the logistics of getting it out of the ground in a way that is environmentally sensitive but also socially responsible,\" he says. Partly because it is environmentally messy, with toxic byproducts, Beijing has gained an advantage by ignoring those consequences. \"China can do it faster and better because they don't have the environmental concerns that we have,\" Elliott says. Many experts agree that the U.S. has enough reserves but lacks the processing capability to go along with it. Simon Jowitt, a geologist and the director of the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, says there are a number of rare earth deposits in the U.S. that have potential, but it's rarely a straightforward proposition. \"You need a source of the rare earths, some way of transporting the rare earths, some way of concentrating the rare earths, and some way of putting those rare earths into a form that they can then be extracted,\" Jowitt says. \"If you don't have one of those, then you end up with something that isn't a mineral deposit and you'll never get anything out of it.\" Last year, China decreed <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/policies/25387-regulations-on-the-management-of-rare-earths\" target=\"_blank\">new regulations</a> for rare earth processing that include strict environmental and safety regulations, but it remains to be seen how stringent enforcement will be. Meanwhile, it not only processes its own ore, but it imports raw ore from places like Southeast Asia and Africa. It's part of a broader strategy by China to set itself up as a global hub for rare earths, according to Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"They put a lot of state resources behind building processing capabilities, such that the minerals come from different places and then they get sent to China for refining,\" Baskaran says. \"What China has been extraordinarily good at is connecting their foreign policy to secure rare earths from around the world.\" <h3>A new process and federal investments</h3> Refining is where ReElement comes in. The company uses large columns in a specialized filtration process developed at Purdue University to extract and purify valuable metals from raw ore, but also recycled rare earths from old magnets. The process is more efficient and less environmentally damaging than older methods, such as those used by China. Jensen, the ReElement CEO, says that method, known as solvent extraction, is \"ecologically challenging\" and difficult to scale. \"It's a dead technology,\" he says, adding that his company's ultimate goal isn't necessarily to achieve U.S. dominance, but to produce enough rare earths domestically to break China's monopoly. The One Big Beautiful Bill passed in July <a href=\"https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/critical-minerals-funding-obb/\" target=\"_blank\">appropriated $7.5 billion</a> toward securing critical minerals. Days later, the Pentagon's Office of Strategic Capital announced a <a href=\"https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Announces-Transformational-Public-Private-Partnership-with-the-Department-of-Defense-to-Accelerate-U-S--Rare-Earth-Magnet-Independence/default.aspx#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20the%20agreement,which%20anchors%20its%20downstream%20capabilities.\" target=\"_blank\">$400 million investment  in MP Materials</a>, making the U.S. government the company's largest shareholder. The Pentagon agency <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/02/2003623435/-1/-1/1/FY25-INVESTMENT-STRATEGY-FOR-OFFICE-OF-STRATEGIC-CAPITAL.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">plans</a> further investments in \"[c]ritical components, raw materials, and rare earth elements utilized in microelectronic manufacturing.\" As part of the deal with ReElement, Vulcan Elements will get a $620 million loan from the Pentagon's OSC with an additional $50 million provided by the Department of Commerce under <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/26/1113470753/chip-production-semiconductor-senate\" target=\"_blank\">the CHIPS and Science Act</a> signed by former President Joe Biden. ReElement Technologies will receive an $80 million loan to support the expansion of its recycling and processing operations. \"I think we're making big strides now because of all the grants and all the critical-mineral-focused grants coming out,\" says Elliott, the University of Texas geology professor. \"I think it really can set us up for success.",

    "title": "How could Trump interfere in the midterms? Here's what voting officials are watching",
    "text": "Less than a year from the midterm elections, state and local voting officials from both major political parties are actively preparing for the possibility of interference by a federal government helmed by President Trump. The problem is, no one knows what might be coming. Steve Simon, the Democratic secretary of state of Minnesota, likened it to planning for natural disasters. \"You have to use your imagination to consider and plan for the most extreme scenario,\" Simon said. Carly Koppes, the Republican clerk of Weld County in Colorado, said officials in her state are shoring up their relationships with local law enforcement and county and state attorney's offices, to make sure any effort to interfere with voting is \"met with a pretty good force of resistance.\" \"We have to plan for the worst and hope we get the best,\" Koppes said. \"I think we're all kind of conditioned at this point to expect anything and everything, and our bingo cards keep getting bigger and bigger with things that we would have never have had on them.\" Trump, who continues to spread false claims about voting in America, issued an executive order in the spring that sought to mandate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/g-s1-55927/trump-voting-citizenship-executive-order\" target=\"_blank\">major changes</a> to the elections system. That order has so far <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429744/trump-elections-executive-order-judge\" target=\"_blank\">mostly been blocked</a> by the courts, but he's teased other executive action as well. And his administration is still <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5538091/trump-administration-requests-to-access-voting-machines-worries-election-officials\" target=\"_blank\">investigating</a> his loss five years ago, while <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/10/nx-s1-5604174/trump-pardons-2020-election\" target=\"_blank\">pardoning</a> people associated with his efforts to try to overturn that defeat. All of that has made it clear to those in the elections community that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a few things voting officials are watching for. <h3>More executive action to take control of voting</h3> The Constitution is <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S4-C1-2/ALDE_00013577/\" target=\"_blank\">clear</a>: States control their own election processes, with Congress able to set guidelines for federal races. The president has virtually no authority when it comes to voting. But Trump is testing that, and those in his circle have pushed fringe theories for how he can change how ballots are cast and counted. <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m4t6vfpfqn2x\" target=\"_blank\">Earlier this month</a>, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House is working on a new executive order that will seemingly target mail voting. Trump also said earlier this year that he wanted to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/18/nx-s1-5506210/trump-mail-in-ballots-ban\" target=\"_blank\">ban some voting machines</a>, though it's unclear exactly what he was referring to. Election officials agree he does not have the legal authority to do either of those things. But recently, Trump ally and attorney Cleta Mitchell, who advised Trump in 2020, broached a bolder strategy to enact election changes: declaring a national emergency. \"The president's authority is limited in his role with regard to elections except where there is a threat to the national sovereignty of the United States — as I think that we can establish with the porous system that we have,\" Mitchell said on a <a href=\"https://www.tonyperkins.com/get.cfm?i=LR25I02#gsc.tab=0\" target=\"_blank\">podcast appearance</a> in September. It would be keeping with one of Trump's broader policy strategies: This year he's invoked presidential emergency powers <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5424666/trump-national-emergencies-democracy-supreme-court-constitution\" target=\"_blank\">more frequently</a> than any other modern president. Election <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RezFBFBPyZA\" target=\"_blank\">experts</a> say there's no legal basis for Mitchell's theory, but numerous voting officials told NPR it's something that's come up in conversations about next year. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who previously oversaw voting in California as secretary of state, also brought up the scenario recently on the Senate floor. \"If the Trump White House tried to declare some fake national emergency to create a pretense for federal intervention, I will force a vote here in the Senate to stop it,\" Padilla said. <h3>Troops on the ground</h3> Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, says six months ago he wouldn't have taken the premise of federal troops at polling places seriously. But seeing how the National Guard was deployed — and justified — this summer changed his thinking. \"You have National Guard deploying to cities to supposedly quell these 'demonstrations' — basically <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/H2eSVJ2R6uA\" target=\"_blank\">people in frog suits</a> and riding their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LUVFxRc_jQ\" target=\"_blank\">bikes naked</a> is the biggest threat,\" Hobbs said. \"And yeah, I start thinking that maybe it could be possible.\" Ahead of the 2020 election, Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/20/politics/trump-election-day-sheriffs\" target=\"_blank\">spoke of</a> a desire to have federal law enforcement patrol voting locations, and this year, his former adviser Steve Bannon said on his <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/steve-bannon/steve-bannon-just-laid-out-maga-media-playbook-subvert-midterms\" target=\"_blank\">War Room podcast</a> that he hopes Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are patrolling polling places in the midterms. Legal <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/federal-and-state-election-laws-ban-federal-forces-polling-places\" target=\"_blank\">experts</a> say such intervention is clearly illegal, but until the federal government disavows such actions clearly, Simon said voting officials have to game out how to respond. \"One thing that would help is if someone at the federal government would come out and categorically say, 'No, no, no, stop the presses, stop everything. You'll never have to worry about that. That's not something we would ever consider doing,'\" Simon said. \"That would go a long way.\" In response to questions about forces outside polling places, and other scenarios mentioned in this story, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson characterized them as \"baseless conspiracy theories and Democrat talking points\" but did not directly answer whether the White House would commit not to send agents to voting locations. She reiterated that the president is permitted to send federal personnel to localities to help quell violent crime. <h3>Who is a trusted source?</h3> For the last decade, as voting officials have fought to dam up a tsunami of false information about their work, they've begged people in their communities to go to \"trusted sources\" for election information. In 2026, figuring out who is a trusted source may be more difficult than ever. Along with Trump himself, his administration has elevated to prominent government roles <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/trumps-administration-is-full-of-election-deniers-theyre-already-working-to-rig-the-vote/?utm_campaign=13200977-Free%20Newsletter%20Emails&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8L6pJNe8sfhw0RoGAMpdgk4KUjt-mzy8uB8071nSSKeAz1BN1wsKlyFCrAXcB-dEKJeCqmcKwp526ap3yxmiQ_We41RA&_hsmi=390587754&utm_content=390587754&utm_source=hs_email\" target=\"_blank\">numerous people</a> who have a history of spreading false information about elections, and local officials worry their message may be drowned out by those with much bigger megaphones. One of the hires alarming voting officials interviewed by NPR works at the Department of Homeland Security. Heather Honey, who's now deputy assistant secretary for elections integrity, worked alongside Mitchell for the past few years to help <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/04/1171159008/eric-investigation-voter-data-election-integrity\" target=\"_blank\">spread election conspiracy theories</a>, including one about votes in Pennsylvania that <a href=\"https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2025-08-27/heather-honey-pennsylvania-election-denier-conspiracy-theorist-trump-dhs\" target=\"_blank\">Trump mentioned</a> in his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before a mob stormed the Capitol. \"I equate this to having a moon landing conspiracy theorist and flat earther being offered a job at NASA,\" Hobbs said. DHS did not respond to NPR's request for comment. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1256332273?ft=nprml&f=1256332273\" target=\"_blank\">Numerous</a> <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/warner-who-said-cia-stole-election-now-leads-doj-civil-rights\" target=\"_blank\">officials</a> at the Department of Justice also have a history of election denial. <h3>Unprecedented demands</h3> The insistence to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5426097/trump-justice-department-voter-data-colorado\" target=\"_blank\">relitigate</a> 2020 also has voting officials worried about what sort of actions administration officials plan to take. Already this year, DOJ has made unprecedented requests to investigate <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/03/trump-2020-election-integrity/\" target=\"_blank\">voting machines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/fulton-county-stands-firm-justice-department-2020-election-files\" target=\"_blank\">access</a> old ballots, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\" target=\"_blank\">accumulate</a> mass amounts of voter data. This summer, a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/02/politics/trump-elections-pressure-campaign\" target=\"_blank\">consultant</a> in Colorado contacted Koppes and other clerks in that state, in some cases saying he was associated with the White House and asking about accessing their voting machines. The White House denied to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/02/politics/trump-elections-pressure-campaign\" target=\"_blank\">CNN</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/colorado-election-clerks-voting-machines\" target=\"_blank\">other outlets</a> authorizing the requests, but separately, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/03/trump-2020-election-integrity/\" target=\"_blank\">in Missouri</a>, a Department of Justice official reached out to clerks there asking basically the same thing. In each instance, they were told no. \"Since 2020, people in the elections world have become even more knowledgeable of the responsibilities of the different levels of government [when it comes to voting equipment],\" Koppes said. A similar push and pull is playing out with elections data. The Trump administration has quickly built what is essentially a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\" target=\"_blank\">searchable national citizenship database</a>, and is trying to entice states to run their voting records through it to root out noncitizens on voter rolls. While many Republican election officials have eagerly embraced the system, other GOP officials and their Democratic counterparts have been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5477367/save-election-citizenship-data-trump\" target=\"_blank\">hesitant to engage with the tool</a>, as there are questions about how well it works, what happens to the voting data once it's been run through the system and, in many states, whether even using the tool is legal under state law. Still, the administration is intent to investigate voter rolls as it continues to push <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5462836/noncitizen-voting-trump-ceir-review\" target=\"_blank\">false narratives</a> about widespread noncitizen voting. The DOJ recently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5554499/doj-sues-eight-states-for-voting-data\" target=\"_blank\">sued</a> eight states (all states Trump lost in 2020) in an effort to compel them to turn over their rolls. \"It's really not a red state or blue state thing,\" said Al Schmidt, the Republican secretary of state of Pennsylvania, in an <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/pennsylvania-election-official-responds-as-doj-sues-state-to-obtain-voter-data\" target=\"_blank\">interview with PBS News Hour</a> about the data demands. \"It is a — in my view, a concerning attempt, a concerning effort to consolidate and overreach at the federal level. In the United States of America, it's the states who run elections, not the federal government.\" <h3>Vulnerable targets</h3> Since Trump took office, the federal government has pulled back on virtually all of its work related to cybersecurity and elections. The Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-security-cisa-kristi-noem-cybersecurity-5bac8ce416c46b4fbe44c94ae5874b39\" target=\"_blank\">laid off</a> employees focused on election security, and stopped <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/us-cuts-funding-ms-isac/\" target=\"_blank\">funding</a> a partnership that helped local elections offices share threat information. Wesley Wilcox, a Republican election supervisor in Marion County, Fla., said smaller counties especially will be more vulnerable to cyberattacks due to the cuts, and Russia, China or any other U.S. adversary may see an opportunity. \"That's what I would do,\" Wilcox said. \"I mean, if I were on that side of the fence, I'm like, 'OK, they're cutting this stuff out. Let's go get them.' You know, 'cause the defenses are down.\" Secretary Hobbs, of Washington, told NPR that two years ago he was notified by DHS about a hack in one of his counties. The state responded immediately to make sure the breach wouldn't impact the voter registration database. Now, Hobbs said, \"I don't even know if I would have gotten that phone call, to tell you the truth.\" In Arizona, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/arizona-secretary-of-state-website-hack-candidate-portal-criticizes-cisa/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he didn't even contact DHS' cyber agency after an online candidate portal was hacked this summer because he didn't have confidence in the agency's \"capacity to collaborate in good faith or to prioritize national security over political theater.",

    "title": "Trump and Mamdani share a cordial White House meeting after months of trading attacks",
    "text": "In a highly anticipated face-to-face meeting, President Trump and New York <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5597788/election-results-zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor\" target=\"_blank\">Mayor-elect</a> Zohran Mamdani described their first in-person conversation as cordial and productive, a striking shift in tone after months of both leaders slinging political attacks at one another. The White House sit-down on Friday marked a stark contrast for the two leaders. Trump has repeatedly sought to paint Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, as too extreme for the city that he long called home. In the president's announcement of the meeting on Truth Social earlier this week, Trump called Mamdani a \"communist.\" However, speaking to reporters after <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/trump-and-mamdani-spark-surprising-bromance-during-white-house-meeting\" target=\"_blank\">the meeting in the Oval Office</a>, that antipathy was nowhere to be found. Trump praised Mamdani's campaign and pledged to work with him on shared policy concerns centered on the cost of living and reducing crime. \"I met with a man who's a very rational person. I met with a man who wants to see – really wants to see – New York be great again,\" said Trump, who was born in Queens, N.Y., the same borough that Mamdani partially represented in the State Assembly. \"I'll be cheering for him.\" Mamdani had previously called Trump a \"despot,\" but standing to his side on Friday he echoed the president's interest in cooperating around shared goals. \"I enjoyed our conversation and I look forward to working together to deliver that affordability for New Yorkers,\" he said. Over the course of just months, Mamdani's candidacy for mayor turned from a long-shot bid to a national movement, sparking interest <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/02/nx-s1-5531004/zohran-mamdani-new-york-young-voters\" target=\"_blank\">far beyond New York</a> in his progressive ideas, including freezing rent in rent-stabilized units, making city buses free and opening city-run grocery stores. It's a platform that quickly caught the ire of many conservative leaders, notably Trump, who made no secret of his opposition to Mamdani following his <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5444846/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-race\" target=\"_blank\">upset win</a> in June's Democratic primary. In the lead-up to Election Day, Trump said he would arrest Mamdani if he disrupted ICE operations in the city, and falsely suggested that Mamdani — a naturalized citizen — was living in the country illegally. At one point, he threatened to pull the city's federal funding were Mamdani to win. He also endorsed Mamdani's rival in the race, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But over the course of his public appearance with Mamdani, Trump told reporters he was surprised by several broad areas of agreement.  \"He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down, all things that I agree with,\" Trump said, while acknowledging that the two leaders \"may disagree how we get there.\" While it's unclear if the meeting will lead to a lasting working relationship, Friday's meeting seemed to signal at least a temporary break from the past rhetoric that defined their relationship.  Trump rose to Mamdani's defense on multiple occasions while speaking to reporters, declining to agree with <a href=\"https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1978943584867860643\" target=\"_blank\">conservative attacks</a> calling Mamdani a \"jihadist,\" and saying he would feel comfortable living in New York City under a Mamdani administration. \"We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,\" Trump explained. \"I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job.\" The president also made light of Mamdani's past comments, where he referred to the president as a \"fascist.\" When reporters asked Mamdani to confirm, Trump interrupted and brushed off the label, telling the incoming mayor, \"That's okay. You can just say yes.\" \"It's easier than explaining it,\" Trump added. \"I don't mind.",

    "title": "In Miami Beach, the New York City mayoral election is an opportunity",
    "text": "MIAMI — People in New York's Times Square recently may have noticed, among the many electronic billboards, images of a beach, blue water and a caption, \"Miami Beach is open for business.\" The ads are being paid for by a Florida developer who believes the election of Democratic Socialist <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5597788/election-results-zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor\" target=\"_blank\">Zohran Mamdani</a> as mayor of New York City is an opportunity to lure wealthy residents and their businesses south. \"We have yet to see how the new mayor is going to do. But there's no question that there's a lot of surprise and shock,\" said <a href=\"https://www.gfoinvestments.com/about/team/russell-galbut\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Galbutt</a>, one of Miami Beach's biggest developers.  Galbutt's ad campaign builds on messaging from Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MayorStevenMeiner\" target=\"_blank\">social media</a>, which was directed at city residents unhappy with the election results. \"We're just highlighting, 'Hey, if you're looking for a law and order city with sunshine, with no state income tax, there's a lot of positives for why you should be here,'\" Meiner told NPR. \"The mayor-elect is a self-described socialist and I think there's a concern about the freedom of businesses to act as capitalist businesses need to. But there's also a concern by Jewish residents and businesses.\" Mamdani alarmed some Jewish voters because of his support for Palestinian rights and critical views of Israel. Exit polls showed Mamdani received about a third of the Jewish vote in this month's election. His office did not return a request for comment on the billboard campaign. Galbutt decided to fund an ad campaign out of frustration over what he views as economic stagnation at one of Florida's most popular resort destinations. After years of violence during spring break, which included some shootings, Miami Beach adopted <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/24/nx-s1-5302909/miami-beach-is-again-cracking-down-to-keep-spring-breakers-away\" target=\"_blank\">tough measures</a> two years ago that have been effective. But a decline in sales tax revenue and business closures since then show something else is needed, the developer said<strong>.</strong>  \"Miami Beach went into an entire campaign to tell people that we didn't want spring breakers in Miami Beach any longer,\" Galbutt said. \"But we never spent five cents or $5 on a campaign saying who we do want.\"  Meiner is more upbeat about the business climate in Miami Beach,  pointing to a $30 million revitalization project underway to boost its Lincoln Road business district.  \"We have Lamborghini ... opening up a showroom in Miami Beach. A Swiss watchmaker is coming here,\" he said. \"There's a lot of investment coming here. And we're just highlighting for people who maybe hadn't thought of Miami Beach, that they should be.\" Meiner said he's received mostly positive comments from residents about his push to attract more New Yorkers to Miami Beach. But he acknowledged he did get some pushback on social media.  \"The negatives,\" he said, \"were really directed like, 'Why are you trying to bring more residents here? We already have a lot of traffic.'\"  Among Miami Beach residents, an informal survey found mostly support for a campaign to bring more New Yorkers to the city. Asked if Miami Beach needs more New Yorkers, retiree Neil Kahanovitz said, \"Well, having come from New York, I wouldn't mind a few more.\" Kahanovitz came to Miami Beach because he got tired of \"the cold, the crowds, the crime and the high taxes.\" As for whether the election of a Democratic Socialist mayor would encourage more people to leave the city? \"It's certainly not going to encourage them to stay,\" he said. Michael Sprotzer, another Miami Beach resident, is skeptical that a wave of New Yorkers and their businesses will soon be heading south. Sprotzer, who works in real estate, noted some of the investment firms who during COVID moved their offices to South Florida, have since moved back to New York. \"I think maybe some people who are thinking about coming to South Florida, it will be a good impetus for them to do so,\" he said. \"But I don't think people who love New York are all of a sudden going to move down here.",

    "text": "The U.S. government on Thursday released a new crash test dummy design that advocates believe will help make cars safer for women. The Department of Transportation will consider using the dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five star-ratings once a final rule is adopted, the agency said in a news release. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men. The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man. The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women. The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said. Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags. Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements but developments have been slow. U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement. \"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said. Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor. \"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said. The department said the new specifications will be available for manufacturers to build models and for the automotive industry to begin testing them in vehicles.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him. In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\" \"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote. Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer. Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing. \"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote. Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums. Michel obtained over $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho — also known as Jho Low — and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign. Michel also tried to end a Justice Department investigation of Low, tampered with two witnesses and perjured himself at trial, prosecutors said. Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence. \"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote. In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative AI program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "text": "Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or the FHFA, said the administration is \"working on\" a plan to introduce 50 year mortgage terms for homebuyers. But some Americans have already been working on their own plans towards homeownership… and it's not the 'nuclear family' route. NPR <em>Embedded</em> producer and editor and author of <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250280916/theothersignificantothers/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Other Significant Others: Reimagining Life with Friendship at the Center</em></a><em>,</em> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/521077630/rhaina-cohen\" target=\"_blank\">Rhaina Cohen</a> and NPR chief economics correspondent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/2788801/scott-horsley\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Horsley</a> join the show to get into the cult of homeownership in America and how we may have to reframe our ideas of what 'adulthood' looks like. <h3><strong>Episode Highlights</strong></h3> <strong>Whether 50-year mortgages are a solution</strong> HORSLEY: The 50-year mortgage is sort of a superficial way to try to make homeownership seem more affordable. But if you scrape just a smidge below the surface, there's not a lot of substance here. Housing affordability is a real challenge. A 50-year mortgage is not a real solution. It would have the effect, potentially, of lowering people's monthly payments a little bit… LUSE: But you have that payment way longer, right? HORSLEY: Yeah, at the cost of adding an extra 20 years. It's like saying, \"Well, your credit card payment would be a lot lower if you just make the minimum payment, but you're going to be in hock for the rest of your life.\" You'll pay a whole lot more in interest and you will take a lot longer to accumulate any equity in your home … this would really chip away at that wealth accumulation piece of home ownership. <strong>Why homeownership is still culturally important </strong> COHEN: I think [homeownership] is offering people a sense of security, that you're not going to get kicked out of your home because you can't afford rent anymore, or that rent prices go so high that you get priced out. That makes people feel like they can stay in a place and also connects to putting down roots … I think homeownership ends up being an almost forcing mechanism to commit to where you are. For a lot of people, it's just what it means to be an adult. As there are these other kinds of markers that have become optional, like marriage, like having kids … homeownership remains, I think, pretty across the board and across the ideological spectrum, something that people really aspire to and represents that they have \"made it.\" <strong>A new approach to homebuying</strong> LUSE: Rhaina, you reported on friends co-buying properties together. What are some of the perks and some of the pitfalls of this pathway to homeownership? COHEN: I was really struck by data from Zillow, and there were a few other reports that were consistent on this, that about 15% of people who had bought homes in 2024, had done so with a friend or relative. The prevalence of this, and certainly the interest in this, is more common as you go to younger generations. … Everybody I talked to also had this social piece as well — they wanted the company of the person that they were living with… One of them had lived alone as a renter and had felt like she had made it, and people respected that as being independent. During the pandemic, she felt lonely … and she decided she wanted to live with others. Ultimately, that led to co-buying. Zillow did research on why people co-buy, and about a quarter of them are doing it because they don't want to live alone. That's a major reason. It's not just affordability.",

She even says the content of people's dreams often changes depending on their location. \"In Wales, I lived on the coast, like by the sea,\" Carr says. \"A lot of people would have recurring dream and nightmare themes that were really about falling into the sea or waves or rainstorms.\" In Carr's new book called<a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250342720/nightmareobscura/\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>Nightmare Obscura</em></a>, she explores the science of dreams, nightmares – even something called dream engineering, where people influence their own dreams while they sleep. \"We know so much about how important sleep is for our health,\" she says. \"But we're only just beginning to uncover whether dreaming and the way that we feel during sleep is significant in our health as well.\" Carr says while frequent or intense nightmares can become distressing, the occasional nightmare may help us work through negative experiences. <em>Interested in any upcoming science books?

    "text": "It's Friday, and there's a new De La Soul album in the world. <em>Cabin In The Sky</em> is the pioneering hip-hop group's first full-length release since founding member Trugoy the Dove died in 2023. The rapper appears on several of the 20 songs, as do guests Black Thought, Killer Mike, Q-Tip and Nas — so we imagine your morning is pretty sorted. That's not the only triumphant return on this week's episode of New Music Friday. Tobias Jesso Jr., a songwriter to the stars who co-wrote 2025 hits like HAIM's \"Relationships,\" Olivia Dean's \"Man I Need\" and Justin Bieber's \"First Place\", released his first solo album in 10 years.  We also have two gorgeous albums by British jazz composer SHOLTO and funk collective Snarky Puppy, and a protest album by Haley Heynderickx and Max Garcia Conover that had us digging out our Pete Seeger albums. All that, plus surprise EPs from Tems and Skrillex. Each week, we welcome a different DJ from the NPR Music network of public radio stations, and this episode's guest is <a href=\"https://www.knkx.org/people/justus-sanchez\" target=\"_blank\">Justus Sanchez, host of The Lounge</a> on KNKX in Seattle and Tacoma, Wash.

    "title": "Fire prompts evacuations at U.N. climate talks in Brazil; 13 suffer smoke inhalation",
    "text": "BELEM, Brazil — A fire briefly spread through pavilions being used for U.N. climate talks in Brazil and prompted evacuations Thursday on the next-to-last day of the conference, and officials said 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation. Organizers said the fire was controlled in about six minutes. Fire officials ordered the evacuation of the entire site for the conference, known as COP30, and it wasn't clear when the talks would resume. Brazil's Tourism Minister Celso Sabino told journalists at the scene that the fire started near the China Pavilion, which was among several pavilions set up for events on the sidelines of the climate talks. The fire quickly spread to neighboring pavilions, said Samuel Rubin, one of the people in charge of an entertainment and culture pavilion. He said nearby pavilions include many of the Africa pavilions and one aimed at youth. Video showed huge flames in one of the pavilions, which are reinforced canvas or fabric structures that typically have three walls and a floor. Para state Gov. Helder Barbalho told local news outlet G1 that a generator failure or a short circuit in a booth may have started the fire. Much of the summit venue in Belem was still under construction right up until the conference opened, with exposed beams, open plywood floors and metal meshed-in corridors leading nowhere outside the convention center. During a pre-summit event, drilling and jackhammering could be heard as world leaders delivered speeches and scores of workers in hardhats scurried around unfinished pavilions shrouded in plastic. Gabi Andrade, a volunteer with COP30 from host city Belem, said she has been working on accreditations at the conference for the last three weeks. Thursday was her first free afternoon and she'd just gotten off her lunch break and was exploring the Singapore pavilion when the fire broke out. She said she saw black smoke. A security guard grabbed her hand and showed her to the exit as she cried and screamed \"fire.\" Beneath the shock of the situation, she worried what this would mean for the Brazilian reputation, hosting the talks. \"It's so sad for us,\" she said. \"We all worked so hard.",

    "title": "The limitations of trash TV, as seen in 'All's Fair'",
    "text": "It's been said before: TV titan Ryan Murphy is the white, openly gay analogue of Tyler Perry. There's certainly evidence to back this up; both ostensibly never sleep seeing as they churn out multiple projects every year, and love giving A-list actresses of a certain age big, bold showcases in work that's rarely, if ever, worthy of their talents. They're also the primary culprits to blame for Kim Kardashian's mortifying but mercifully rare forays into \"acting.\" The omnipresent influencer is currently starring in Murphy's much-talked about new show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SVJMKNfF0w\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All's Fair</em></a> (their second collaboration after <em>American Horror Story: Delicate</em>)<em> </em>and it's clear her skills have<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4nDoqa11WI\" target=\"_blank\"> hardly improved</a> in the years since Tyler Perry's <em>Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor</em> in 2013. If you've heard about <em>All's Fair</em> but haven't witnessed the lavishly gauche spectacle for yourself, I'm here to tell you: It's as terrible as everyone says it is. The show is about an all-female law firm that specializes in helping wealthy women procure the best divorce settlements from their dirtbag one-percenter husbands — think a far less high-stakes and much goofier spin on <em>Scandal</em>'s<em> </em>Olivia Pope & Associates. Kardashian — who has famously long been studying to become a lawyer but <a href=\"https://ew.com/kim-kardashian-breaks-down-in-tears-after-studying-for-law-exams-11850863\" target=\"_blank\">has yet to pass the bar</a> — plays one of the high-powered partners at the law firm, and woodenly leads a cast of actual actresses that includes Naomi Watts, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash-Betts and Sarah Paulson, none of whom can overcome the bland script. In nonsensical and over-the-top execution, <em>All's Fair </em>is just as hard to watch as anything Perry's ever put his stamp on. Zoom out a bit, though, and the similarities between the two are less pronounced. There's a winking campiness in much of Murphy's work that doesn't surface within the earnestly bad, Christian-soaked oeuvre of Perry. The former's also demonstrated a discernible talent for balancing high and low art in messy but effective ways, going all the way back to the cheeky high school dramedy <em>Popular</em> to the tabloid anthologies <em>American Crime Story </em>and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/16/1197961860/does-feud-capote-vs-the-swans-ruffle-enough-feathers\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Feud</em></a> and the subversive melodrama<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/06/06/1000646372/farewell-to-pose-which-fused-grief-and-joy-right-up-to-the-finale\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>Pose</em></a> (the brainchild of Afro-Latino co-creator and showrunner Steven Canals). In this manner, I'd align Murphy more closely with the far less prolific Lee Daniels, their tastes always steeped in explicitly queer sensibilities, with frequencies running the gamut from uber-schlock to populist kitsch to soapy melodrama, or some other amalgamation of the bunch. Season 1 of Daniels' <em>Empire</em>, which gave Taraji P. Henson a role for the ages as fierce matriarch Cookie Lyon, is a provocative blast — Douglas Sirk-ian gloss by way of the Chitlin' Circuit. Unfortunately, as Daniels and Murphy's more recent output insists, intending to produce camp or something like it doesn't always yield \"so bad it's good\" — or even merely interesting — results. There's a direct line to be drawn from Glenn Close's bonkers turn as a Jesus-loving, recovering addict grandma in Daniels' supernatural monstrosity <em>The Deliverance</em> (I'm still recovering from <em>her</em> deliverance of a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/glenn-close-deliverance-meme.html\" target=\"_blank\">certain crass line that went viral</a>) to her wading into the high-end muck of <em>All's Fair</em>; I have to wonder if her willingness to do the former inspired her casting in the latter. Whether it did or not, both projects function as expressions of tedium deceivingly gussied up to look like a fun time; their provocations come off so purposefully silly as to seem embarrassingly strained. <em>All's Fair</em>'s fumbling attempt to position itself as a rah-rah sisterhood story only exaggerates how unpleasant the viewing experience is, especially in these times. It's much more difficult to look past a subpar script and meme-forward performances<strong> </strong>when the overall vibe is stale and hallow: these characters, sashaying in luxury fits across decadent mansions and corporate spaces and spouting vapid girlboss-era platitudes, speak of themselves as though they're the posterchildren for modern feminism, just because they help socialite clients in bad marriages stay wealthy post-divorce. (To this, I quote Kourtney, Kardashian's IRL sister: \"<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kardskatchup/video/7411973687416753454?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">There's people that are dying</a>.\") A scenery-ingesting Paulson, meanwhile, is the show's evil Ethel Merman, playing all the way past the back of the house, through the lobby, and out into the parking lot as the proudly anti-feminist rival attorney, sneering such colorful prose as \"Beef curtains. Black Mae West,\" when nastily addressing Kardashian and Nash-Betts' characters. She's committed to the bit, because she's a professional and one of our greats, but even she can't save this dreck. At least you could argue,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/opinion/netflix-hollywood-ryan-murphy.html\" target=\"_blank\"> as I have before</a>, that something like Murphy's supremely ridiculous series <em>Hollywood</em> — which imagined, among other things, an alternate universe wherein a pre-fame Rock Hudson was able to come out as gay alongside a Black partner and suffer no real consequences to his career — showed a bit of transgression. <em>All's Fair</em> is so mind-bogglingly stupid it could make even the most ardent defender of Murphy's particular brand of prestige-y trash throw their hands up in agony. Is it hate-watchable nevertheless? I guess this is where <em>All's Fair </em>shares another thing in common with the works of Tyler Perry: <em>no one</em> should hate themselves this much.

    "title": "Judge orders an end to Trump's troop deployment in D.C., calling it 'unlawful'",
    "text": "A federal judge on Thursday ordered an end to the monthslong National Guard deployment in Washington, D.C. to tackle crime, declaring that the use of troops was \"unlawful.\" It's the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5612793/national-guard-tennessee-trump-court-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\"><u>latest legal resistance</u></a> against President Trump's troop deployments in American cities as a means to suppress protests, combat crime or safeguard federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. It comes just days after a Tennessee state judge issued a temporary block on the mobilization of Guard forces in Memphis, which was activated by the Tennessee governor at Trump's behest. Over the weekend, the Defense Department ordered <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/16/nx-s1-5610485/national-guard-chicago-portland-texas-california\" target=\"_blank\"><u>hundreds of troops to leave Chicago and Portland, Ore.</u></a> as federal courts kept those deployments at a stalemate. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, sided with District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb who had argued that the president undermined the city's autonomy, threatened public safety by stirring tensions between local residents and law enforcement and hurt the city's economy. \"The Court finds that the District's exercise of sovereign powers within its jurisdiction is irreparably harmed by Defendants' actions in deploying the Guards,\" she wrote. Cobb put a pause on her order until Dec. 11 to allow the Trump administration time to appeal. In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson asserted that Trump was well within his authority to send the Guard to D.C. \"This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of DC residents — to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC,\" Jackson added. Trump sent hundreds of troops to D.C. without the mayor's consent in early August after declaring a \"crime emergency\" in the city. That claim has been repeatedly refuted by local Democratic leaders. Since then, Guard personnel have been largely tasked with patrols and beautification efforts like clearing trash, spreading mulch and pruning trees. As of Wednesday, the deployment in the nation's capital includes over 2,100 Guard forces from D.C. and several states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama, according to the U.S. Army.",

Sánchez jokes that it might be \"the world's most unlikely band.\" Their story traces back to 2019, when Fleck and Castañeda shared a duo set at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phOKmRf5QnU\" target=\"_blank\">captured on video by Jazz Night in America</a>. When Sánchez later invited Fleck to record for a studio project, Castañeda joined the session, and the three quickly discovered how naturally their sounds fit together despite coming from very different musical traditions. Fleck is a banjo virtuoso who has redrawn the instrument's boundaries across genres. Castañeda has transformed the Colombian harp into an instrument capable of both rhythmic drive and harmonic flexibility. Sánchez is a drummer whose narrative approach to rhythm has made him one of the most distinctive voices on the instrument. \"When we play together, we lock. It's like one person,\" Fleck says. The BEATrio's debut recording, which came out in May, earned a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5600968/2026-grammys-complete-list-of-nominations\" target=\"_blank\">Grammy nomination</a>; a tour begins next year.

    "title": "An NPR reporter traveled into Gaza with the Israeli military. Was that the right choice?",
    "text": "NPR and other Western news organizations have been pressuring Israel <a href=\"https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=a4081f625eb0ca4d6fdba534f81187857ab81c26f2c5e85ae443a8831bf714d31b055ee5cf6ab1078d20e3e4603b5075a0869f7d20dd7fbe\" target=\"_blank\">for months</a> to let their journalists travel independently into Gaza to report on the war. So far, Israel has refused to do so. When the Israeli military offered to escort a group of journalists, including one from NPR, into Gaza on Nov. 5 to see the \"yellow line\" — the area now controlled by Israeli forces where Palestinians are forbidden to even approach — the network had to decide if the constraints imposed by Israel were worth the trip. In order to go, NPR had to agree to let military censors view the reporter's raw material, including videos and interviews, before the network could use it. It's the kind of compromise that serious journalists refuse in almost every other scenario, because it undermines a reporter's ability to make independent judgments about what story to tell. Politicians don't get to see raw material gathered from the campaign trail. Athletes don't get to see the videos or photos recorded during training camp. But when it comes to Gaza and other war zones, it's often the only way for a journalist to get a glimpse of what's happening on the ground. After discussing with his editors, NPR international correspondent Daniel Estrin went on the trip. He reported a story for <em>All Things Considered</em>, did a two-way interview with <em>Morning Edition</em>, and he created a video that was posted on <a href=\"https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=a4081f625eb0ca4de3f6cade004e43c372971fbdfdbb000c11a9bc6027eb95f42e693ffa31cc739fa0101581c02f672dd6ac071a7bb3ab07\" target=\"_blank\">NPR's Instagram account</a>. The audience reacted immediately on social media, posting dozens of comments criticizing his decision to embed. We asked Estrin and one of his editors how they made their decision. <em>— Kelly McBride</em> <h3><strong>Why a reporter agreed to comply with Israeli censors</strong></h3> After NPR posted a video to Instagram documenting international correspondent Daniel Estrin's trip into Gaza with the Israeli army, audience members reacted. Here's a sample of their comments: <blockquote><div><p>@thesilverlining_1970: <em>This is a propaganda trip, not journalism</em></p></div></blockquote> <blockquote><div><p>@diggy2763: <em>Ended? They never really stopped the bombings. Way to mislead the public @npr are you owned as well?</em></p></div></blockquote> <blockquote><div><p>@yellin4u: <em>Outrageous site, so utterly sad what humans can do to one another. Thank you for being eyes on the destruction. May it never occur again.</em></p></div></blockquote> <blockquote><div><p>@insert_clever_rhetoric: <em>Noting the exact censorship while respectfully accepting the invite and the conversation is the pinnacle of ethical journalism in a situation like this</em></p></div></blockquote> <blockquote><div><p>@tbarclay8: <em>If you can’t interview the opposing side, you know nothing!</em></p></div></blockquote> Estrin's entire trip into Gaza with the Israeli military took roughly two hours. It only took a few minutes to travel from the border to the base. Once there, Estrin talked to some of the soldiers, walked to the top of the berm that marks the yellow line, and looked out into the rest of Gaza. He shot video of everything he could. And he turned the camera on himself and recorded his personal observations, some of which made it into his radio report and his Instagram video. I asked Estrin to describe the journalistic value of the information he gained. He wrote this in an email to me: \"We gained a firsthand perspective we could not have gained in any other way. I visited an elevated Israeli military outpost in northern Gaza with a panoramic view of the devastation of the Shujaiya neighborhood of Gaza City. The destruction stretched as far as the eye could see. I also saw an Israeli military outpost up close and could observe the infrastructure Israel has built as it prepares to occupy Gaza for the foreseeable future. I saw up close the vast destruction of Shujaiya within the territory under Israel's control, seeing entire swaths of depopulated territory Palestinians are not allowed to access. This is a vantage point that's inaccessible even to Anas Baba, NPR's journalist on the other side of the yellow line in Gaza City.\" Of course, the information Estrin relayed was only what the Israeli military wanted him to see. The interviews with soldiers produced no stunning revelations. There were no images or voices of Palestinians who have endured the war. It was telling that one soldier was wearing a T-shirt with a graphic design and the words \"Hamas Hunting Club.\" IDF censors saw the video and did not flag it. In the end, the military censors cleared the entirety of Estrin's material for his radio reports. His finished stories were not subject to review. James Hider, NPR's Middle East editor, told me that even though embedded reporting trips are limited in their ability to surface information, he believed the NPR audience gained a previously unseen view of the war. \"Daniel has been to Gaza many times before the war, and to hear him experience that moment of seeing that almost everything had gone, I think was a very powerful journalistic moment,\" Hider said. \"I think a lot of people responded to that.\" Estrin's view of Gaza isn't the only perspective the audience has access to. Listeners and readers have also been hearing and seeing work from Anas Baba, a Gaza resident who has survived the war while reporting on it for NPR. But as a Palestinian, Baba could not approach the yellow line. NPR was transparent about the restrictions. The Instagram video included a caption that described the restrictions Estrin faced, explaining that the censors wouldn't let Estrin document images of a military map of Gaza. Likewise, the introduction to Estrin's <em>All Things Considered</em> <a href=\"https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=a4081f625eb0ca4d552a5b686fea299a7e2f01089c69a3856d40abf502d3a121a9c7fccb35d44556316bbf2fde37c93a791f34676304f3a4\" target=\"_blank\">story</a> explained the restrictions as well. He described the newly erected Israeli military outpost, the surrounding destruction and his own reaction, comparing the neighborhood he used to drive through, which has been reduced to rubble. He did a <a href=\"https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=a4081f625eb0ca4d7c4b8071aea964919b9791a352766874b992fada8e7c2dafeb0468a599d3068f0a054275a33c18c1de58febe3e8fa950\" target=\"_blank\">two-way interview</a> the next day on <em>Morning Edition</em> with host Leila Fadel. She asked if he could speak to any Palestinians. \"Were you able to report freely? To talk to Palestinians? And it's been over two years, when will Israel start allowing international journalists access without a military escort?\" Estrin answered, \"We were restricted on who we could interview. We did not meet Palestinians. And we had to submit our raw audio and video to Israel's military censor, that's the law here, but none of the content of this reporting was altered. The Israeli government has a Nov. 23 deadline to tell the Supreme Court its position on independent entry for journalists to Gaza.\" Someone from NPR could have shared more information with the audience, explaining not just the terms of the compromise, but why they agreed to it and what they hoped to gain from this embedded trip. A reporter from the BBC was on the same trip. The BBC published this note with <a href=\"https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=a4081f625eb0ca4d6863ec6c67b4b3b52ade6702e9e0c98f9df1da30d78cdc879d9080be752bf75953073b594ef2d651bfef749861ac84ba\" target=\"_blank\">their story</a>, \"Israel does not allow news organisations to report independently from Gaza. Today it took a group of journalists, including the BBC, into the area of the Strip occupied by Israeli forces. The brief visit was highly controlled and offered no access to Palestinians, or other areas of Gaza. Military censorship laws in Israel mean that military personnel were shown our material before publication. The BBC maintained editorial control of this report at all times.\" The note is more explicit than NPR's explanations. But it still doesn't address the question of why go at all. Going forward, it will be important for NPR to address both issues. Many people in the audience want a view into those conversations. Even if they can't weigh in, seeing NPR's reasoning for accepting the trip helps the audience judge whether the information gained truly adds to NPR's overall <a href=\"https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=a4081f625eb0ca4dbacdfc20c697baf3f312830a377511a92f1bc71f986966cc91da459768995c5a00def4503e1eba9b96d6f564e51353fa\" target=\"_blank\">body of reporting</a>. Hider wasn't opposed to this approach. \"I think that would be a separate piece,\" he said. \"That would be an interesting debate to have about the modalities of embedding. But … this was more about Gaza than the reporter. And we wanted our first on-the-ground visit by our correspondent in Israel to, you know, to pack that punch of, you know, what he saw.\" I believe NPR will have more opportunities to let the audience see their deliberations. As the ceasefire progresses and the United Nations' approved <a href=\"https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=a4081f625eb0ca4d2bd50bc139642ce28d9ee70b335517b16cbd4728d906b96d9aed927c09bb0491226f7bdb5ef8cc662708e55a618bbce4\" target=\"_blank\">stabilization force</a> takes shape, there will be more opportunities for journalists to travel into Gaza both under official escort and, eventually, on their own, without censors. Then newsrooms will have to weigh the restrictions of the first approach against the safety risks of the second. The most biting criticism was the accusation that NPR, in accepting the invitation from the military to tour the base, was participating in Israeli propaganda and not journalism. If this were all that NPR was reporting, that scathing accusation would be closer to true. But NPR has an extensive body of work on the war, including viewpoints from all sides. NPR is one of the only American newsrooms with a reporter in Gaza. And NPR has appropriately focused on the suffering of Gazans over the past two years. The reporting from the military embed was a single view of the war on a single day from an Israeli military base. It wasn't the whole truth. But it wasn't propaganda, either. When added to the broader body of NPR's reporting, it adds to our understanding of the war. Because Estrin said yes, the NPR audience gained added insights. Even if it wasn't groundbreaking, the reporting added value. And Estrin managed to do the work with his eye on the needs of the audience, not on the Israeli soldiers who were escorting him in and out of Gaza. <em>— Kelly McBride</em> <hr /> <em>The Office of the Public Editor is a team.

    "title": "Recalled baby formula linked to a botulism outbreak may still be in some stores",
    "text": "Infant formula linked to a botulism outbreak that has sickened dozens of babies across 15 states may still be on store shelves even after being recalled, federal health officials say. As of Wednesday, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-infant-botulism-infant-formula-november-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said</a>, 31 cases of suspected or confirmed infant botulism have been reported in babies who consumed ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula and got sick between August and mid-November. No deaths have been reported. But all 31 babies were hospitalized with the illness, which can cause a potentially <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/infant-botulism\" target=\"_blank\">life-threatening form of gradual paralysis</a> in infants less than a year old. \"Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula might be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, which is causing infant illness in multiple regions of the country,\" the FDA said. ByHeart Whole Nutrition recalled two batches of its infant formula earlier this month before <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/byheart-updates-information-regarding-voluntary-recall-all-batches-byheart-whole-nutrition-infant\" target=\"_blank\">expanding the recall</a> to all of its products — which include cans and single-serve packets — last week. They are sold at major retailers — including Target, Publix, Walmart and Whole Foods — and online nationwide, with some products shipped to customers outside the U.S. ByHeart, which describes itself as a \"next-generation baby nutrition company,\" first hit the market in 2022. The FDA says its products make up \"approximately 1%\" of all infant formula sold in the U.S., so it does not have concerns about a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/09/23/1124558475/baby-formula-shortage-crisis-fda-internal-review\" target=\"_blank\">potential shortage</a>. In an <a href=\"https://byheart.com/pages/an-update-from-our-founders-on-our-voluntary-recall-november-2025\" target=\"_blank\">apology note</a> to parents, ByHeart says it is cooperating with the FDA and \"investigating every facet of our process\" to identify the cause of the outbreak. In the meantime, the company — along with the FDA — is urging adults to stop using the formula and monitor their babies for symptoms of botulism. The FDA is also asking stores to stop selling the product. But in its Wednesday update, the agency said it had \"received reports that recalled formula is still being found on store shelves in multiple states.\" NPR has reached out to the FDA for more information but did not hear back by publication time. The FDA says it is working with state partners and retailers \"to ensure an effective recall\" as its investigation into the outbreak continues. <h3>What we know about the outbreak</h3> As of Wednesday, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-infant-botulism-infant-formula-november-2025\" target=\"_blank\">FDA said </a>the 31 cases had been reported in 15 states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington. The outbreak has grown since the FDA first announced its investigation on Nov. 8. At that point, it said that out of an estimated 83 cases of infant botulism reported nationwide since August, 13 of the infants had consumed ByHeart formula at some point. That raised red flags, because botulism is uncommon in dairy products and \"there is no historical precedent of infant formula causing infant botulism,\" the FDA said. In response, ByHeart promptly recalled two batches of its products. The next day, <a href=\"https://byheart.com/pages/nov-9-an-update-from-our-founders-on-our-voluntary-recall-november-2025\" target=\"_blank\">it announced</a> that the California Department of Public Health had tested a sample from one of those batches, and the result came back positive for Clostridium botulinum, the bacteria that causes infant botulism. That sample came from an opened can, which ByHeart originally said did not prove that its product was to blame (as the bacteria can occur naturally in places like soil and dust). But in an <a href=\"https://byheart.com/pages/an-update-from-our-founders-on-our-voluntary-recall-november-2025\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ on its website</a>, it now says further testing by a third-party group identified the bacteria in some samples of unopened formula, too. <a href=\"https://byheart.com/pages/nov-11-an-update-from-our-founders-on-our-voluntary-recall-november-2025\" target=\"_blank\">ByHeart says</a> the FDA informed it in a \"late-night call\" on Nov. 10 that it had found two more cases of infant botulism in babies that had consumed its formula. The next day, ByHeart, citing \"too many unanswered questions,\" recalled all of its products and released information for parents about <a href=\"https://byheart.com/pages/how-to-switch-infant-formulas\" target=\"_blank\">how to switch</a> to a different formula brand. <h3>What to know about infant botulism </h3> Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by Clostridium botulinum. When a baby swallows the spores, \"they grow in the gut and make toxin,\" according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/hcp/clinical-overview/infant-botulism.html\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC). Symptoms can appear three to 30 days after consuming the bacteria, and generally start with constipation, poor feeding, difficulty swallowing and loss of head control. \"If untreated, infants with infant botulism experience a progressive, flaccid paralysis that can lead to breathing difficulties and require weeks of hospitalization,\" the CDC says. Treatment for infant botulism involves an antitoxin known as BabyBIG, which is administered through an IV. The CDC says parents should stay vigilant for several weeks after their baby last consumed ByHeart formula. They are advised to wash contaminated surfaces and label any leftover powder \"DO NOT USE\" and store it safely for a month, in case their infant develops symptoms and the state health department wants to test it. The CDC says parents should seek immediate medical care if they see any concerning symptoms, and also directs them to an infant <a href=\"https://www.infantbotulism.org/\" target=\"_blank\">botulism outbreak hotline</a> from the California Department of Public Health set up specifically to respond to this outbreak. <h3>What the company is doing </h3> ByHeart says it is conducting its own \"extensive testing\" and giving the FDA \"complete and unrestricted access to all of our facilities and products for their investigation.\" The company has released <a href=\"https://byheart.com/pages/nov-13-2025-an-update-from-our-founders\" target=\"_blank\">more resources</a> for customers in the days since the recall, like a 24/7 support hotline and refunds for purchases since October. It has <a href=\"https://byheart.com/pages/nov-19-2025-an-update-from-our-founders\" target=\"_blank\">also pledged</a> to implement stronger safeguards and testing in the future, saying that Clostridium botulinum was \"not among the pathogens routinely tested for across the industry\" — until now. In the meantime, several affected family members have taken legal action. The parents of two four-month-olds who were hospitalized with infant botulism — in Arizona and Kentucky — filed <a href=\"https://marlerclark.filevineapp.com/s/30e2bVzbLab6vpgPAXHfxELI4MOombgG4meYs4TvFfGOxBsgETLx4bnw/files\" target=\"_blank\">separate</a> federal <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26277162-948087862-hanna-everett-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuits </a>last week. They accused ByHeart of negligence and are seeking compensation for medical bills and emotional distress after both their daughters required hospitalization. A separate <a href=\"https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-11-13-byheart-valenzuela-complaint.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">class-action suit</a> filed in New York alleges deceptive marketing. ByHeart told NPR over email that it cannot comment on litigation, but reiterated its commitment to supporting families and the FDA's investigation.",

    "title": "White House condemns Democratic lawmakers' video but backs off Trump's posts",
    "text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday President Trump does not actually want to see members of Congress executed despite his social media post earlier in the day, calling a video by some members \"seditious behavior, punishable by DEATH!\" Trump made a pair of posts on his site, Truth Social, in response to a video posted by Reps. Jason Crow, D-Colo., Chris DeLuzio, D-Pa, Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., and Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., where the lawmakers address members of the military and intelligence communities and said, \"You can refuse illegal orders,\" repeating the phrase several times before saying, \"You must refuse illegal orders.\" The lawmakers said, \"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens.\" <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2558895077819811\" target=\"_blank\">The video, posted to Facebook</a>, also says \"right now the threats of our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad but right here at home.\" They added: \"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.\" Asked during the daily White House briefing if he wanted execute members of Congress, Leavitt said: \"No.\" \"The sanctity of our military rests on the chain of command, and if that chain of command is broken, it can lead to people getting killed. It can lead to chaos, and that's what these members of Congress who swore an oath to abide by the Constitution are essentially encouraging,\" Leavitt said. The president also reposted a series of comments from users on Truth Social, including posts that said the Democrats should be hanged, the actions were an insurrection and they should all be indicted because of the video. In the video Democrats didn't call out any specific actions that military or intelligence officials have been told to carry out. They also said that military and intelligence personnel swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. They ended the video by telling those in the military and intelligence officials, \"Don't give up the ship,\" referring to the famous last words of James Lawrence, a Navy Captain during the war of 1812, to keep fighting and not surrender. Members of the military do swear an oath to the Constitution and are trained that \"following orders\" is not a defense for illegal acts. The lawmakers issued a joint statement to Trump's response, saying in part, \"We are veterans and national security professionals who love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.\" \"Every American must unite and condemn the President's calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity,\" they said. House Democratic leadership — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California — called for Trump to remove the posts and for Republicans to condemn them. \"We unequivocally condemn Donald Trump's disgusting and dangerous death threats against Members of Congress and call on House Republicans to forcefully do the same,\" they wrote. \"We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families,\" the statement adds. \"Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed.\" Trump hasn't deleted the social media posts.",

    "title": "Rosalía and sombr crack the top 10 on the charts for the first time",
    "text": "<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/120581188/taylor-swift\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor Swift</a> has the top album and song in the country yet again, as <em>The Life of a Showgirl</em> and \"The Fate of Ophelia\" hold down the No. 1 spots for a sixth consecutive week. But even as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/g-s1-86665/sombr\" target=\"_blank\">sombr</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/663524172/rosalia\" target=\"_blank\">Rosalía</a> hit new career highs, there's a major churn taking place just below the top 10, as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15324690/mariah-carey\" target=\"_blank\">Mariah Carey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1186162452/wham\" target=\"_blank\">Wham!</a> and their cheerful ilk gear up for yet another jingling assault on the charts. <h3>TOP STORY</h3> Last week, the <em>Billboard</em> charts <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5607015/michael-jackson-thriller-charts-halloween\" target=\"_blank\">absorbed the full force of spooky season</a>, as a weekend of Halloween parties produced a Hot 100 full of scary-ish songs and a return to the top 10 for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/16782748/michael-jackson\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Jackson</a>'s \"Thriller.\" At the same time, a <em>different</em> holiday began its annual attack on the chart, as two Christmas classics — Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" and Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\" — made an auspiciously early return. A week later, \"Thriller\" and their ilk have been sent back to molder in their crypts once more, while Christmas streamers who couldn't wait for Thanksgiving (you know who you are) have gone ham — and not in the seasonally appropriate, honey-glazed way — on the Hot 100. We should consider it a small win that none of them crash the top 10, but with \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" at No. 11 and \"Last Christmas\" at No. 13, we're merely delaying the inevitable here. \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" came <em>this close</em> to thwarting a major career milestone: As \"Back to Friends\" ticks up a spot to No. 10, sombr has become just the 10th artist to hit the Hot 100's top 10 for the first time in 2025. Another would-be first-timer came close this week, as country star Cody Johnson debuts on this week's chart at No. 12 with his cover of \"Travelin' Soldier.\" The track, written by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2013/03/24/175078115/partners-in-life-two-country-singers-finally-meet-in-the-studio\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Robison</a> and popularized by the act known at the time as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15399450/dixie-chicks\" target=\"_blank\">The Dixie Chicks</a>, has become a signature song for Johnson; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOAabd-_rxw\" target=\"_blank\">his 2022 performance of \"Travelin' Soldier\"</a> has accumulated 59 million views on YouTube, and now it's got a studio version to match. But if he's going to hit the top 10 for the first time in his career — this is his eighth time hitting the Hot 100 — he's probably gonna have to wait until January. <h3>TOP ALBUMS</h3> The Hot 100 isn't the only major <em>Billboard</em> chart to welcome a first-timer to its top 10: Spanish polymath Rosalía, whose 2022 album <em>Motomami</em> peaked at No. 33, blows away that career high as <em>Lux</em> debuts at No. 4. For an album that expands her sound well beyond chart-friendly genres — she recorded it with the London Symphony Orchestra — <em>Lux</em> wasn't necessarily an easy sell as a pop hit. Future weeks will tell the full story, of course, as an initial sales burst gives way to word of mouth and what will likely be a tsunami of placements on \"Best Albums of 2025\" lists. The other top 10 debut is also a first-timer, but with an asterisk: Yeonjun, a member of the K-pop boy band <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1214780899/tomorrow-x-together\" target=\"_blank\">Tomorrow X Together</a>, lands at No. 10 with his first solo effort, <em>No Labels: Part 01</em>. Tomorrow X Together is a frequent visitor to the top 10, but Yeonjun now has a hit of his own. There's one other serious chart breakthrough worth noting this week: After months of teasing and leaked tracks — and after entering the <em>Billboard</em> 200 albums chart at No. 173 last week — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/125860421/paramore\" target=\"_blank\">Paramore</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/801280331/hayley-williams\" target=\"_blank\">Hayley Williams</a> makes a huge jump with her new solo record, <em>Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party</em>. Buoyed by an official release and the addition of two new tracks, the album zips all the way to No. 12. <h3>TOP SONGS</h3> \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" and \"Last Christmas\" are just two of the nine holiday songs in this week's top 50, and the order in which they appear is instructive. Because, while it might seem as if the exact same holiday songs appear on each year's charts in roughly the exact same order, it's possible to plot out incremental shifts in audience preferences, year over year. For example, there was a moment when <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1217531506/brenda-lee\" target=\"_blank\">Brenda Lee</a>'s \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" seemed to be overtaking \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" — roughly around the time the still-living Lee released a video in 2023 for her 1958 hit. But in the time since, \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" has ceded its chart dominance to Mariah Carey <em>and</em> Wham!. This week, Lee re-enters the Hot 100 at No. 19, so that pecking order looks to persist in 2025. Bobby Helms' 1957 staple \"Jingle Bell Rock\" follows at No. 20, re-entering alongside its sibling in the microgenre of \"holiday songs that evoke rock and roll without actually rocking.\" Next up are the two most recently minted holiday standards, both of which have climbed steadily in recent years: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/522184181/ariana-grande\" target=\"_blank\">Ariana Grande</a>'s 2014 hit \"Santa Tell Me\" at No. 30 and, from 2013, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/91208383/kelly-clarkson\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Clarkson</a>'s \"Underneath the Tree\" at No. 41. Their strength, relative to other holiday hits, appears to be growing. Then, rounding out this week's holiday selections — remember that old, previously charting songs can only re-enter the Hot 100 if they're in the top 50 — are two gelatinous slabs of moldy fruitcake (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2009/10/31/114361963/andy-williams-memoirs-of-moon-river\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Williams</a>' \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" at No. 47 and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/668309383/michael-bubl\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Bublé</a>'s \"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" at No. 48) and one gleaming gem (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15392890/nat-king-cole\" target=\"_blank\">Nat \"King\" Cole</a>'s \"The Christmas Song\" at No. 50). Bublé's strength and momentum, year over year, is especially notable and alarming: The Canadian singer has yet to hit the Hot 100's top 10 in his career, but he looks extremely well-positioned to do so this time around. (He's also got this week's highest-charting holiday album: <em>Christmas</em>, at No. 25.) And, because the charts are kind of inherently a zero-sum game, there's a whiff of bad news for the Ives Hive. Burl Ives has been a staple of the top 5 — as recently as December 2024 — with his 1964 recording of \"A Holly Jolly Christmas.\" But, at least so far, it's absent from this year's initial chart flurries. The Ives Dive can only be blamed on one Scroogey scourge: Michael freaking Bublé, whose own take on the song debuted at No. 37 at the very beginning of this year. If Bublé becomes the new literal standard-bearer where \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" is concerned, then that's bad news for 1) the estate of Burl Ives; and 2) everyone with taste. Justice for Burl!",

    "title": "The CDC revives debunked 'link' between childhood vaccines and autism",
    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made a dramatic about-face in the agency's position on the relationship between vaccines and autism. The CDC's website now says a link between vaccines and autism <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>cannot be ruled out</u></a>. That's a reversal from the CDC's longstanding stance that there is no link. The change comes even though a connection between vaccines and autism has long been debunked by a large body of high-quality research. But Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5285571/the-history-behind-an-enduring-public-health-falsehood-that-vaccines-cause-autism\" target=\"_blank\">long promoted the discredited claim</a>. The CDC's change is alarming public health experts. They are already worried about a drop in childhood vaccination, which has led to a resurgence of dangerous childhood diseases like measles and whooping cough. \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has been changed to promote false information suggesting vaccines cause autism,\" said Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement. \"Since 1998, independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people. The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There's no link between vaccines and autism.\" She went on to say, \"Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents. We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.\" In a statement to NPR, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon repeated one of the changes to the website: \"The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.\" He said the department \"has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.\" \"The new statement shows a lack of understanding of the term 'evidence,'\" the <a href=\"https://autismsciencefoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Autism Science Foundation</u></a> said in a statement the organization provided to NPR, adding, \"No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines.\" It's a statement that's confusing by design, said <a href=\"https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Paul Offitt</a>, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"These are the usual anti-vaccine tropes, misrepresentation of studies, false equivalence,\" he says. \"They might as well say chicken nuggets might cause autism because you can't prove that either.\" The changes on the website \"blindsided\" career scientists at CDC, says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former top CDC official who resigned from the agency in August. \"The scientists did not participate in its creation,\" he says. \"And the data are unvetted.\" Two current CDC staffers, who contacted NPR Thursday, say the updates are a glaring red flag that indicate the vaccine information on the agency website is no longer credible, and is instead \"anti-science.\" They requested anonymity out of concern they could lose their jobs for speaking to the press. The moves are the latest in a series of steps Kennedy has taken on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines that run counter to mainstream medical and scientific organizations like the pediatrics academy, the Infectious Disease Society of American and the American College of Physicians. Vaccine proponents say the moves are recklessly undermining public confidence in vaccines and fueling vaccine hesitancy, putting the nation's children at risk. The U.S. appears to be poised to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5604686/canada-loses-measles-free-status-raising-alarms-among-experts\" target=\"_blank\"><u>lose its status as having eliminated measles</u></a>. Kennedy sacked all the members of the CDC's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, earlier this year and replaced the members with his own slate. In one of its first actions, the new advisory committee called for the removal of the preservative thimerosal used in a small fraction of flu vaccines, even though safety concerns about it have also been debunked. Under Kennedy, federal health agencies have also made it harder for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and canceled grants funding new vaccines that rely on mRNA technology at the heart of the most used COVID vaccines. The Trump administration has also claimed there is a link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and autism, and promoted the use of leucovorin, a prescription form of vitamin B9, to treat autism <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5552751/autism-leucovorin-folinic-acid-folate-vitamin-reality-check\" target=\"_blank\"><u>even though the evidence supporting that is scant</u></a>. An ACIP working group is now studying more major changes in childhood vaccinations, including removing compounds that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/31/g-s1-95419/aluminum-salts-vaccines-safety-rfk-cdc\" target=\"_blank\"><u>include aluminum used to increase vaccine effectiveness</u></a>. These adjuvants have been used safely for nearly a century. The committee is also exploring <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5576321/childhood-vaccine-schedule-rfk-cdc\" target=\"_blank\"><u>separating a single shot now given to protect against measles, mumps and rubella in a single shot</u></a> into individual shots. Public health experts say both moves are scientifically unsound and would essentially upend the nation's childhood vaccination regimen, leaving children vulnerable to diseases that had long been brought under control. The committee is also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542405/rfk-jr-acip-vaccine-advisory-panel-vote-delay-hepatitis-b-shot-in-infants\" target=\"_blank\"><u>considering recommending delaying vaccinating children against hepatitis B</u></a>. For years, all babies have been vaccinated against hepatitis at birth. Hepatitis B can cause liver failure and liver cancer. The CDC acknowledges in a footnote on its main webpage on autism and vaccines that it still carries a header reading \"Vaccines do not cause autism*\" and says it hasn't \"been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.\" NPR emailed Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy's office for comment but didn't receive an immediate response. Cassidy chairs the Senate HELP Committee, which vetted Kennedy's nomination to lead HHS and voted along party lines to support it. Cassidy <a href=\"https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1991599014270365829?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">posted on X Thursday afternoon</a>: \"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases. What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.",

    "title": "These families' health care costs will balloon if Congress doesn't act on the ACA",
    "text": "The government shutdown has ended without resolving a fight over health insurance. Congress failed to extend enhanced tax credits that have helped millions of Americans on Affordable Care Act plans cover their plan costs since 2021. Senate Republicans have promised a vote on the enhanced subsidies before the end of the year. But open enrollment for these plans is already underway and consumers are facing sky-high prices and little certainty about whether they'll get relief. And making matters worse, insurers have raised prices on these plans because they predict that without the tax credits, healthier people may not sign up in 2026, leaving them a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/26/nx-s1-5577940/health-insurance-government-shutdown-aca-open-enrollment-death-spiral\" target=\"_blank\">sicker, costlier pool of customers</a>. Premiums on the marketplaces are rising by an average of 26% next year,<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/quick-take/aca-insurers-are-raising-premiums-by-an-estimated-26-but-most-enrollees-could-see-sharper-increases-in-what-they-pay/\" target=\"_blank\"> according to health policy organization KFF</a>. That's the largest rate increase since 2018. There's less than a month to go before the Dec. 15 deadline to sign up for a plan that begins Jan. 1. If Congress doesn't act before then, some people may have to choose between paying far more than they're comfortable with or forgoing insurance altogether. Here are their stories: <h3>She \"can't swing\" an extra $1,000 a month</h3> <em>Amy Jackson, Butler, Mo.</em> Amy Jackson, 56, works in medical billing at an independent urgent care center. She buys coverage on the ACA marketplace because her employer is too small to have health benefits. She says her current premiums are affordable for her at $275 a month but will go to $1,250 in 2026 without the tax credit. Going without insurance is really not an option for her. In October, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. So she's rushing to get in as much treatment as she can before the year ends, but she'll still need coverage for follow-up appointments next year. Since she works in the medical field, she says she knows the insurance industry is part of the problem here. But she says people like her need help now, and lawmakers need to understand that. \"For them, a thousand bucks is probably nothing. It's probably what they blow on dinner. But for me, that's half of my wage,\" she says. \"I just can't swing that.\" <h3>\"A very daunting amount of money\" for a retiree</h3> <em>Robert Bixon, Boynton Beach, Fla.</em> A 61-year-old retiree, Robert Bixon, faces 2026 premiums of $4,500 a month to cover himself, his wife, and one of his sons. That's $54,000 a year, plus potentially spending up to $15,000 for their out-of-pocket maximum. Bixon says he knew he'd have to pay for health care out of pocket after retiring from his career as a small business owner. \"But,\" he says, \"in my wildest dreams, I never thought a number close to $70,000 a year would be the cost that I'd be facing.\" \"It's a very daunting amount of money,\" he says. What scares Bixon even more is that prices could keep going up: \"Twelve months from now, we could be having the same conversation and I could be looking at another 20% or 30% increase.\" \"I wonder if I'm going to be able to live out my days and enjoy my retirement and not run out of money,\" he says. Still, Bixon isn't willing to risk living without insurance before becoming eligible for Medicare at 65. He has spent his entire adult life saving and investing for retirement and says he \"can't risk getting wiped out by long-term hospitalization.\" \"I just don't understand how the leadership in this country can find that acceptable for working-class Americans — people who started businesses, helped employ other people, paid taxes — now [are] looking at these kinds of health care costs,\" he says. <h3>Fears losing access to treatment for his bipolar disorder</h3> <em>Ezra McKay, Memphis, Tenn.</em> Ezra McKay, 26, works part-time as a bookseller. He was kicked off his mother's plan, and his employer won't give him enough hours to get on the employer plan. So he buys his own insurance on the ACA marketplace. He has bipolar disorder and the insurance, which covers his doctors' visits and prescriptions, has been a game changer for his health. Having that covered, he says \"has been such a relief. It's just made me feel important and valid, like I deserve to exist or something like that.\" But without the subsidy, his premium for next year will go from $15 per month to $550, which is nearly half his monthly income. Without insurance to cover his medication, McKay says, \"I would be in an extremely bad situation of having difficulty maintaining my job, maintaining my house, maybe even having a life-threatening situation, if I were to have a mental health crisis.\" He says he is considering moving to California or Washington state, where state programs offer more secure coverage. <h3>\"Where along the lines did I not do the right thing?\"</h3> <em>Catriona Johnson, Chapel Hill, N.C.</em> Before the ACA, 44-year-old Catriona Johnson had to live without health insurance for several years because she had a pre-existing condition. She was born with a congenital abnormality that required multiple surgeries in her abdomen and still requires her to use a catheter every day. She says that the preventative care she got access to through ACA has increased her quality of health enough for her to earn her Master of Social Work degree. Currently, she pays $442 a month for her premium with the tax credit, but that is set to go up to $666 next year. Her deductible will jump by $1,000. Insurance is critical for her as she requires ongoing medical care. \"I have no idea what I am going to do if I cannot afford care. Just go day by day, keep trying,\" she says. Johnson says she's always tried to do things right. Despite her serious health problems, she went to college and grad school and has a job. Still, she lives paycheck to paycheck as a contract social worker in private practice, with most of her credit card bills being medical-related — medical supplies, medications, doctors' appointments.  She wonders, \"Where along the lines did I not do the right thing?\" She worries that the rise in costs for her health insurance will affect her credit, which already happened in her 20s because of medical debt. \"Everything I can't pay — on to the credit card, to worry about another day.\" <h3>To cover an extra $1,300 a month, he'll stop contributing to retirement</h3> <em>Chris O'Donnell, Richmond, Va. </em> After he got laid off from his job this summer, Chris O'Donnell, 58, started a freelance business. He gets his health insurance through Virginia's ACA marketplace.  He and his wife currently pay $837 a month for their plan. Without subsidies, the 2026 cost will be $2155 — that's $1,300 more per month. O'Donnell says he plans to redirect the money he would have saved for retirement to cover the added premium costs. \"This is not the time to be zeroing out my retirement contributions, but what choice do I have?\" His wife has diabetes and is a cancer survivor, so \"not having insurance is just completely out of the question,\" he says. \"Even if I wanted to go without health insurance, just the supplies for her insulin pump would cost $25,000 a year anyway, so I wouldn't actually be saving anything.\" He and his wife are seriously considering retirement in a country where health care costs are more stable. \"If this is the new normal and then you figure, health insurance is going to go up 20% every year, then I don't know that long-term staying in this country is going to be sustainable for us,\" he says. <h3>With the cost more than doubling, she might forgo health insurance</h3> <em>Celeste Jameson, North Port, Fla.</em> For paralegal Celeste Jameson, 41, her monthly insurance premiums will more than double next year, from $266 to $593. \"I can't afford $593 a month. I just can't, on top of all of my other living expenses,\" Jameson <a href=\"https://www.wusf.org/health-news-florida/2025-11-18/soaring-health-care-costs-stun-tampa-area-workers-who-buy-insurance-through-aca\" target=\"_blank\"><em>told WUSF.</em></a> As a young adult, she suffered from severe abdominal and pelvic pain that went undiagnosed until just over 10 years ago, when she was finally able to get reliable health insurance through the ACA marketplace. \"I was in and out of hospitals with severe pain, ovarian contusions and everything, with no insurance,\" she said. The bills piled up. She got into medical debt. In 2014, after being rushed to the emergency room in \"probably the worst pain I'd ever had,\" a doctor diagnosed her with endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other parts of the body. Once she felt better, she was able to take on regular work as a paralegal. She credits her health insurance with finally helping her get the diagnosis that led to her improved health. She has not yet renewed her insurance for next year. \"It scares me to know or to even imagine that I could be back where I was before 2014,\" she said. <h3>\"I'd rather eat nothing but PB&Js than give up my health insurance.\"</h3> <em>Kelly Badeau, Tucson, Ariz.</em> Kelly Badeau is facing monthly insurance costs of nearly nine times what she is paying now. She currently pays $94 per month for a silver ACA plan after the tax credits, and her 2026 plan will cost an estimated $900. Before becoming self-employed 10 years ago, she had \"bare bones\" insurance with a high deductible through an employer. Her current ACA silver plan \"is the best insurance I've ever had,\" she says. It has allowed her to take a proactive approach to her health, including annual primary care visits, screenings like mammograms and a colonoscopy, and seeing an audiologist. \"With the ACA, I'm healthier both mentally and physically,\" she says. She says she doesn't want to drop her current plan. \"I'd rather eat nothing but PB&Js than give up my health insurance,\" she says. Badeau sold her home last year and says she'll have to use some of that money to pay for health care. \"I will dip into my savings to make my payments next year,\" she says. \"I don't want this administration to think they can tank the ACA by making us suffer.\" But Badeau worries that she might have to start cutting corners in her health if she has too many medical expenses and can't afford the co-pays. She takes blood pressure medication and hormone therapy for menopause. \"I'm just trying to keep my head above water until I can get Medicare, but that's still many years from now,\" she says. <h3>She worries she'll become disabled without health care</h3> <em>Genna Boatright, Siren, Wis.</em> Genna Boatright, 40, has an aggressive case of rheumatoid arthritis and relies on medication to control it. She is currently only paying $12 a month for her insurance premium because the enhanced subsidy covers most of her cost. But she says without the tax credit, her new premium costs will be $700, based on the numbers she's seeing in the marketplace. \"And that I absolutely cannot afford,\" she says. She says her income changed this year, and when she went onto the marketplace to shop for plans, she was pushed to apply for Medicaid. But she was denied Medicaid coverage. So she's continuing to see what is possible and waiting to see if anything changes with the prices. \"The flood of overwhelm has been real,\" she says. She worries about how she will get coverage she can afford and is \"trying to make it through the days.\" \"I do worry that without insurance and specialty care and the medication that I'm on, how quickly I will become disabled,\" she says. \"And that's an absolutely terrifying prospect.\" <h3>As a self-employed therapist, her ACA plan is her only option for insurance</h3> <em>Kristine Weidner, Branford, Conn.</em> Self-employed as a psychotherapist, Kristine Weidner, 62, says the cost of the plan she buys on the ACA marketplace will nearly triple in 2026. Her current high-deductible plan costs $589 a month, not including dental, and a comparable plan for 2026 will cost $1691 a month. She's really worried about the cost and about meeting the deductible. \"If I include dental, it will cost more than my housing,\" she says. And she has \"no other option\" for health care. Going without insurance, she says, isn't a wise choice at her age. She's also worried the rising costs may impact volume in her business as some clients may forgo insurance and not be able to afford her services.  \"I may need to consider closing my business and returning to the public sector and employer-based insurance.\" <em>NPR's Margaux Bauerlein and Selena Simmons-Duffin and WUSF's Kerry Sheridan contributed reporting.</em>",

    "title": "Cincinnati school district to open parking lot to students experiencing homelessness",
    "text": "More than 4,000 students in the Cincinnati Public School System are experiencing homelessness, and approximately 300 of them are sleeping outside or in vehicles. Project Connect, a homeless advocacy organization within the school system, has a plan to help those students and their families: It’s called a “Safe Sleep Lot,” and it&#8217;s set to open in March of 2026. It would allow families to sleep in their cars in a designated lot while they await temporary or long-term housing. In order to get into the Cincinnati shelter system, a case worker must see a person sleeping in their car. But according to Rebeka Beach, the program manager for Project Connect, families move around a lot, making it difficult for case workers to get eyes on them. Setting up a designated place to park would allow officials to see the families and then move them into housing. For Beach, the issue is personal. When she was 16, her family was displaced and lost their house. Beach said she couch surfed until a neighbor took her in and encouraged her to stay focused on her education. Beach said that just one intervention or adult supporting a child experiencing homelessness can have a profound impact. “Just trying to ensure that your basic needs are being met really takes you out of the mode of focusing on education because you&#8217;re in survival mode,” Beach said. “When those needs are met, a child is much better suited to be successful in terms of educational outcomes.” <h3>4 questions with Rebeka Beach</h3> <strong>Can you describe why you started the project?</strong> “Last school year, our program provided emergency housing support to 355 students. And that means that 355 students were either sleeping outside in vehicles or in places unfit for human habitats, such as laundromats, storage units, and we just really identified an increase. “Our program serves over 4,000 students a year, but many of those students are couch surfing or in hotels. &#8220;This growth in the number of unhoused students has been really concerning for us. There are several reasons around that, but we decided to create a space where our families could sleep that would have security and would have access to bathroom facilities and showers, cell phone charging stations, and then resources at our resource center during the day.” <strong>What kind of resources are you providing?</strong> “There&#8217;s a federal law, the [McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act], that requires school districts to remove educational barriers for students experiencing homelessness. &#8220;So, at a basic level, most programs provide school supplies, uniforms, backpacks and items like that. But our program really goes above the letter of the law, and we provide holistic support to our students. “We actually have a resource center where we provide all of those items that I mentioned, as well as services through partner agencies. So, for example, Hamilton County Department of Jobs and Family Services can provide intake and recertification for families who are applying for [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] or cash benefits.” <strong>But having a safe place to sleep is the main resource, right?</strong> “We intend to have 12 spots because we are seeing on any given night three to five families sleeping in their cars. And so, the number that I gave you is over the course of a school year. So, we do believe that this will meet the need, but there is additional space for three additional parking spots if the need arises. “People will be able to park from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., so they will have to leave during the day. This is from March 2026, when it begins, and through November.” <strong>Are you expecting the lot to be full each night?</strong> “We really don&#8217;t expect it to be full each night. We are anticipating about six families sleeping in the lot each night. But we don&#8217;t know. I mean, we don&#8217;t know until we open what that will look like. “We are seeing more and more families sleeping in their vehicles, so we may be surprised by the numbers. We&#8217;re facing cuts to housing, so that will, I think, deepen the need because really, the lot is a bridge. “We know it&#8217;s not a solution, but we receive feedback from parents that they really feel unsafe sleeping in their cars, and they have to move frequently throughout the night.” <em>This interview was edited for clarity.</em> ____ <em>Jenna Griffiths produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/catherine-welch\">Catherine Welch</a>. <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/grace-griffin\">Grace Griffin</a> produced it for the web.</em> This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/11/20/homeless-students\">WBUR.org.</a><img src=\"https://pixel.wbur.org/1055208\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;\" />",

    "title": "'A Man on the Inside' goes to college, and Ted Danson aces the test",
    "text": "Creator <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/21/nx-s1-5192631/a-man-on-the-inside-michael-schur\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Schur</a>'s inspiration for his Netflix series <em>A Man on the Inside</em> was a really unusual one. It's based on a documentary from Chile, called <em>The Mole Agent</em>, which told the story of an octogenarian hired by a private eye firm to solve a case of theft in an elder care facility — by going undercover as a new resident. Schur cast <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/04/1244130926/ted-danson-cheers-good-place-aging-mary-steenburgen-light-dark\" target=\"_blank\">Ted Danson</a>, the pivotal player in his wildly surprising <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/31/801540105/a-goodbye-to-the-good-place\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Good Place</em> </a>sitcom, in the central role, and surrounded him with endearing and talented co-stars and supporting players.  The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/21/g-s1-35205/a-man-on-the-inside-is-one-of-the-sweetest-tv-series-since-ted-lasso\" target=\"_blank\">first season</a> of <em>A Man on the Inside</em> was very funny, and its central mystery was a good one — but most of all, the series was about family, and friendship and explorations of such issues as trust, usefulness and mortality. Like <em>The Good Place</em>, it was a very philosophical comedy. And now, for Season 2, <em>A Man on the Inside</em> returns with an even stronger story. With the way Schur flipped the entire premise of <em>The Good Place</em> for the second season of that show, you know he's capable of some unexpected plot twists, and he serves up several of them here.  This time the setting is a small college, where a wealthy and abrasive major benefactor has rubbed lots of people the wrong way. The school administrators come to the detective agency run by Julie — played once again by Lilah Richcreek Estrada — to investigate acts of theft and vandalism targeting the controversial donor. And she, in turn, dispatches Charles, played by Danson, to go undercover, by assuming a role he once held in his own past: professor of engineering. This allows for a whole new cast of supporting characters, and this season of <em>A Man on the Inside</em> delivers magnificently. One faculty member, a music teacher, is played by Danson's real-life wife, actor <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/22/1177600607/mary-steenburgen\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Steenburgen</a>, who charms Charles — and viewers — instantly.  Another <em>Man on the Inside</em> newcomer is David Strathairn. I've loved his work ever since he played a bookstore owner on <em>The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd</em> in the '80s. You may remember him from such movies as <em>The Firm, Lincoln</em> or <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2005/10/07/4949516/good-night-and-good-luck-anatomy-of-a-witch-hunt\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Good Night, and Good Luck</em></a>. In <em>A Man on the Inside</em>, he gives Danson someone really feisty to play against. It's not Sam and Diane from <em>Cheers</em>, but I cheer every scene they share together. Yet another new cast member, and terrific foil for the other actors, is Gary Cole, who plays the wealthy donor, Brad Vinick. Like Steenburgen and Danson, Cole also broke out as an actor in the 1980s, in the murder-mystery miniseries <em>Fatal Vision.</em> He's bounced ever since between comedy and drama, including memorable stints playing the same character, Kurt, on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/05/06/404209225/the-husband-and-wife-power-couple-behind-cbss-the-good-wife\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Good Wife</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/02/19/516137854/the-good-fight-offers-edgier-version-of-the-good-wife-in-series-debut\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Good Fight</em></a><em>. </em>In<em> A Man on the Inside</em>, his character enjoys repelling just about everyone. Schur, whose other comedy credits include <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/30/848506248/from-parks-and-recreation-a-brief-but-delightful-return-to-pawnee\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Parks and Recreation</em></a><em>,</em> and his writing staff clearly have a blast making this show. Some character names are playfully preposterous. One entire episode, set at a Thanksgiving dinner, seems to be an extended parody of the intense holiday feast episode of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5440466/the-bear-season-4-review\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Bear</em></a><em>.</em>  And as it progresses, the show finds ways of involving actors and characters from last year — yes, that means Sally Struthers and Stephanie Beatriz are back — without forgetting to focus on Charles and his family, especially Mary Elizabeth Ellis as his daughter, Emily. <em>A Man on the Inside</em> is a light, easily digestible show, but it's also full of moments that linger with you. Some thoughtful, others emotional. And what lingers with me the most, after previewing all of Season 2, is what a deeply gifted and impressive actor Danson is. And not just here. Think of it: On TV, since the '80s, he's been outstanding as a supporting cast member on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/05/1242529156/a-curb-your-enthusiasm-appreciation-as-the-series-comes-to-an-end\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em></a> and <em>Damages</em>, and as the central character on <em>Cheers, Becker, The Good Place</em> … and now, you can add to that list his late-career work on <em>A Man on the Inside</em>. This may end up as one of his most triumphant credits of them all.",

    "title": "Surf's down! Munich, until now an inland surfing hotspot, has lost its biggest wave",
    "text": "MUNICH — \"It was gnarly. Dangerous. Only the most experienced could surf it,\" says Jakob Netzer of what local surfers have come to call the \"E1,\" an ever-churning wave along a mountain stream that flows through central Munich — a swell that non-surfers and tourists know as the <em>Eisbachwelle </em>or \"ice stream wave.\"<em> </em> \"And it's very sad the wave is not working,\" says Netzer, staring at where the wave once regularly appeared, just below a bridge that marks the entrance to the city's English Garden.  In early November, as city engineers finished dredging the bottom of the Eisbach<em> — </em>a two-kilometer-long (1.2-mile) canal that is a side arm of the Isar River — they opened the floodgates to find the <em>Eisbachwelle</em>, typically a 1.5-meter (4.9 feet) high summit of icy river water, had transformed into a small, nondescript whitewater bump along a raging waterway. \"It's usually three sections,\" says Netzer, who has surfed the <em>Eisbachwelle</em> for years. The wave stretches across all three. \"On the far side, you jump in and there are these bumps, and then in the middle, you have a nice, smoother place where you can surf, but it's not easy, because you have to anticipate the sections and know where to make the turns.\" Netzer recalls the first time he surfed the wave, at the age of 17. \"I was working in a bar and one of my bar colleagues took me to go on the Wave in the middle of the night after our shift ended,\" he remembers. \"I actually didn't think much about it, I just did it.\" It was the beginning of a surfing addiction, says Netzer. He's regularly surfed both E1 and its less challenging sibling E2, further downstream, ever since — come rain, shine, or snow, when he dons his full-body wetsuit. Fellow surfer Alexander Neumann of the Munich River Surfers' Association says over the years, the city's engineers have routinely dredged the Eisbach<em> </em>canal — but they did so with greater scrutiny this year due to the <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/eisbachwelle-in-muenchen-staatsanwaltschaft-stellt-ermittlungen-nach-tod-von-eisbach-surferin-ein-a-561e32f1-0b0d-4f97-b1c1-64ea723f4ffe\" target=\"_blank\"><u>drowning death</u></a> of a surfer on the <em>Eisbachwelle</em> last April. \"They wanted to find if there are any danger zones where people could get stuck,\" he explains. \"So they took a bit too much out, which used to still lay on the ground of the wave, and the wave is not forming properly now.\" In response to questions about how the city of Munich is addressing the disappearance of the <em>Eisbachwelle</em>, spokesperson Susanne Mühlbauer issued a statement to NPR: \"For Munich, the Eisbach wave is a symbol of urban sports and leisure culture, as well as a globally unique and popular tourist attraction that complements and rounds off the city's range of sights in an outstanding way — and that's why Munich Tourism hopes the Eisbach wave will return quickly.\" Down the street from where the <em>Eisbachwelle </em>used to exist, at the Technical University of Munich, hydrology professor Markus Disse opens up a textbook to a chapter on hydraulic jumps, a hydrological phenomenon that occurs along a fast-moving waterway like the Eisbach, which creates a surfable wave. Disse says a wave like the <em>Eisbachwelle </em>requires a certain water speed combined with a \"bump\" of sediment on the bottom of the stream.  Disse says he thinks the city likely removed that underwater bump. \"They did their job too good,\" he says, smiling. How to resurrect the <em>Eisbachwelle</em>? \"I would play around with the discharge,\" says Disse. \"Perhaps they should try lowering the discharge, wait half an hour, then you see the effect, and you could do a series of experiments.\" Disse says if that doesn't work, then Munich authorities should attempt to dump gravel into the canal to re-create the \"bump\" of sediment that likely created the wave in the first place. Back on the banks of the Eisbach Canal, Neumann watches an engineering team from Hamburg — hired by the city of Munich to study why the wave disappeared and in charge of bringing it back — fasten GPS and sonar equipment to a boogie board before they let it go into the river to test water flow and graph the underwater structure of the riverbed. He says he trusts that the city has the surfers' best interests in mind. Surfing along this stretch of the canal — which was owned until 2010 by the state of Bavaria — used to be illegal until the city stepped in and initiated a land swap with Bavaria in order to legalize surfing along the <em>Eisbachwelle. </em> The city's tourism board includes the site in its marketing, and Neumann says the <em>Eisbachwelle</em> has become an integral part of the city. Still, surfers have become impatient with the pace of the work to resurrect the wave. A week after it disappeared, Neumann says, a group of surfers submerged a wooden ramp where the wave once stood, and for a day, the wave came back. However, authorities deemed the ramp an illegal structure and removed it. The city continues to work on a solution. <em>Esme Nicholson contributed to this report from Berlin.            </em>",

Comey faces false statement and obstruction charges tied to congressional testimony he gave in 2020. <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\"><li>🎧 <strong>Former federal prosecutors expressed to NPR's Ryan Lucus that the fact that the full jury didn't see the final indictment is a self-inflicted wound</strong> by the government.

Epstein gave former Trump strategist Steve Bannon advice on how to build a far-right political movement in Europe. There were also several high-profile Democrats in Epstein's orbit, and the president is directing the DOJ to investigate links among the prominent names, including former President Bill Clinton. But some of Epstein's accusers are urging Trump to avoid partisanship and focus on the <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5614956:nx-s1-mx-5815291\" target=\"_blank\">powerful people that they say have not faced scrutiny</a>, regardless of political affiliation.</li></ul> <strong>Tech company Nvidia announced yesterday that it generated $32 billion in profit over the last three months.</strong> In recent weeks, it reached a valuation of $5 trillion.

AI-related stocks make up almost half of the value of the S&P 500.

    "title": "Ahead of the holidays, consumer and child advocacy groups warn against AI toys",
    "text": "A nonprofit children's safety organization, Fairplay, is urging gift givers to avoid buying AI toys for children this holiday season, according to an <a href=\"https://fairplayforkids.org/pf/aitoyadvisory/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>advisory</u></a> issued on Thursday. Fairplay, along with other child and consumer advocacy groups, say these toys – playthings like plushies, dolls, action figures, and kids' robots embedded with chatbots and other artificial intelligence technologies – can be dangerous. Designed to mimic human behaviors and interact with kids as if they were friends, the toys offer novelty at a time when AI is starting to infiltrate many corners of peoples' lives. Fairplay's advisory, headlined \"AI Toys are NOT safe for kids,\" says these toys prey on children's trust and disrupt human relationships, among other harms. The advisory was endorsed by more than 150 experts and groups including MIT professor and author Sherry Turkle, pediatrician and researcher Jenny Radesky, Social Media Victims Law Center, and International Play Association USA. \"It's ridiculous to expect young children to avoid potential harm here,\" said Rachel Franz, a Fairplay program director, in a statement to NPR. \"Young children are especially susceptible to the potential harms of these toys, such as invading their privacy, collecting data, engendering false trust and friendship, and displacing what they need to thrive, like human-to-human interactions and time to play with all their senses. These can have long and short-term impacts on development.\" <strong>Others share concerns</strong> The advisory follows similar recent warnings from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). The consumer rights nonprofit's 40th annual \"Trouble in Toyland\" <a href=\"https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/trouble-in-toyland-2025-a-i-bots-and-toxics-represent-hidden-dangers/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>report</u></a> says some AI toys enable in-depth talk about sexually explicit topics, have few parental controls, and collect a mountain of data about their underage owners. \"All of them are collecting your child's voices, potentially. They're collecting their names, their dates of birth. All kinds of information – the kid's likes, dislikes, favorite toys, favorite friends,\" said Teresa Murray, co-author of the PIRG report and director of its consumer watchdog program, in an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/nx-s1-5611070/report-finds-some-ai-enabled-toys-shared-inappropriate-content-or-collected-data\" target=\"_blank\"><u>interview</u></a> with NPR. \"Because they're connected to the internet, so anything is available, who knows what those toys might start talking to your children about with their friends or their friends' parents or your neighborhood? I mean, it's terrifying.\" <strong>Toy industry and AI players highlight safety and privacy</strong> The toy industry and AI companies are responding to such fears by highlighting their focus on safety and privacy. OpenAI said it suspended the maker of the AI-powered teddy bear Kumma earlier this week, after <a href=\"https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/trouble-in-toyland-2025-a-i-bots-and-toxics-represent-hidden-dangers/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>PIRG reported</u></a> the toy was sharing questionable advice with minors, such as providing details about how to find and ignite matches. When prompted by researchers, it also talked in-depth about sexual matters. \"We suspended this developer [the Singapore-based toymaker FoloToy] for violating our policies,\" OpenAI spokesperson Gaby Raila said in an email to NPR. \"Our usage policies prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old. These rules apply to every developer using our API, and we monitor and enforce them to ensure our services are not used to harm minors.\" <em> </em> The company's technologies are also embedded in other AI toys including the AI robot pet Loona, and it entered into a <a href=\"https://corporate.mattel.com/news/mattel-and-openai-announce-strategic-collaboration\" target=\"_blank\"><u>strategic partnership</u></a> with Mattel earlier this year \"to support AI-powered products and experiences based on Mattel's brands.\" No products have yet been announced. But the company said the initial set of Mattel products and experiences will focus on families and older customers, not users under 13. Fairplay singled out several AI toys to demonstrate the potential risks of data collection and the impact on a child's understanding of trust. Among them are <a href=\"http://miko.ai/products/miko-3\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Miko</u></a>, a cute plastic robot that comes with educational games and the tagline \"Built to be your new best friend,\" <a href=\"https://us.keyirobot.com/products/loona?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22232617361&gbraid=0AAAAApazz3Nx3nwmWkCYuugcCvIsBHZU8&gclid=CjwKCAiAz_DIBhBJEiwAVH2XwLNUlx5L98eIhVM1RbaLa3O223Io8rydhtjgyiS3DUNIwQe0FyIGfBoCnP4QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Loona Petbot</u></a>, a small, plastic robot companion that moves around on wheels and has a screen and ear-like, and <a href=\"https://heycurio.com/product/gabbo\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Gabbo</u></a>, a cube-shaped robot plushy with big anime-style eyes. It has no screen, but can be connected to wifi and do voice chat. NPR has reached out to the makers of these products for comment. \"Children's safety is our top priority,\" said Curio, the company behind Gabbo and other AI playthings, in a statement to NPR. \"Our guardrails are meticulously designed to protect kids, and we encourage parents to monitor conversations, track insights, and choose the controls that work best for their family on the Curio: Interactive Toys app.\" \"Facial recognition on Miko 3 is entirely optional and exists solely to help families enjoy a more personalized and interactive experience,\" said Ritvik Sharma, a senior vice president at Miko.ai, in an email to NPR. \"Importantly, all visual data is processed locally on the device. It is never sent to the cloud or shared externally. To offer families greater confidence and control, every Miko robot includes a physical camera shutter that allows parents to completely block the camera whenever they choose.\" In an email to NPR, The Toy Association, which represents toy manufacturers, said toys sold by responsible manufacturers and retailers must adhere to more than 100 strict federal safety standards and tests, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which governs children's privacy and data security online and is overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. \"The Toy Association urges parents and caregivers to shop only from reputable toymakers, brands, and retailers who prioritize children's safety above all else,\" the statement said, adding that it offers <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/url.avanan.click/v2/r01/___https:/playsafe.org/playsafe/toy-safety-tips.aspx?WebsiteKey=e07a4d3d-87f0-415a-bafb-453f810abd27&hkey=7c2877de-d31e-4e4a-bcd7-75ef8e4dfc45&5d514819d7e8=7*235d514819d7e8___.YXAzOmxpdHpreTphOm86NGVmMDE0ZTg1MDI1ZDhmMTMxMzRjZmYzMTYyNzMyY2Q6NzpiOWJlOjMyNjFjM2Q0NGI2NmIyM2Y2MTdhZDg4Y2I4YzEyYjg0YzQwY2UyN2ZmYzk0YWQ4N2MzYjg2YzQ2OWIwODg0Mzc6aDpGOk4__;JQ!!Iwwt!Q1geTOLXTPZ6DOE9KAPqd9DyohtPWJ9rFy1NhI0EaDQKQWbx4Ujb7cahDcBPzAA1qUqdv9L9UAyCwNd2FA$\" target=\"_blank\"><u>safety tips for A.I. and other connected products</u></a> to better inform peoples' buying decisions.",

    "title": "'Wicked: For Good': This all could've been just one good movie",
    "text": "And we're back! Our national nightmare — the year-long wait between Jon M. Chu's<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/22/1214662571/wicked-is-that-good-shiz\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>Wicked: Part I</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Wicked: For Good </em>— has finally come to an end.<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/19/nx-s1-5175607/wicked-movie-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo\" target=\"_blank\"> When we last left</a> Chu's splashy, long-awaited adaptation of the Broadway musical juggernaut, green emo outcast Elphaba, soon to be known as the Wicked Witch of the West (Cynthia Erivo), had been radicalized by the discovery that the revered Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) is a magicless fraud and oppressor of animals; she thus committed to<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeqj5GnoFUY\" target=\"_blank\"> defying gravity</a> and becoming a broomstick-riding outlaw. Her polar-opposite enemy-turned-bestie Glinda (Ariana Grande) declined to take up the cause but wished Elphaba well. Songs were belted, hearts were broken, blonde hair was tossed, and since then, the real world we're all existing in only grew more chaotic and distressingly parallel to that of the one depicted in Oz. <em>Wicked: For Good</em> is based on the show's second act, and ever since it was announced that the two hour and 45-minute production (including intermission) would be sprawled across two separate films totaling an approximate five-hour runtime, people like me have wondered, <em>What's the (non-capitalistic) point of that?</em> Having now seen <em>For Good</em>, I can attest there isn't a point, or at least not a wholly convincing one. This installment is far from a total misfire — thank goodness Erivo and Grande are such captivating performers perfectly-suited to these roles — but the over-padding and stuffing meant to justify this bifurcated packaging soon becomes readily apparent. First, however, it starts off with a bang: The exciting opening sequence touches down upon the vast open landscape outside the metropolis of Oz, as the Wizard's human lackeys are forcing animals to do the brutal labor of building his precious yellow brick road; suddenly, Elphaba appears out of the sky like a superhero and wields her mighty powers to disrupt the abuse and send a message. The Wizard's press secretary Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh, tasked again with trying to sing, to limited results) has pulled out all the stops to spread hateful propaganda about Elphaba to the people of Oz, and the people are buying it wholesale. A willfully ignorant Glinda is now the bubbly spokesperson for the Wizard's regime, keeping the lie about his wizarding credentials alive. And the formerly apathetic Fiyero (<a href=\"https://people.com/jonathan-bailey-is-sexiest-man-alive-2025-11842000\" target=\"_blank\">Sexiest Man Alive</a> Jonathan Bailey) is now a reluctant guardsman arranged to marry Glinda, even though his heart and political sympathies remain with Elphaba. A lot happens over the next two-plus hours, including the story coinciding with the arrival of that girl from Kansas (glimpsed a few times here, but as far as I can remember, not heard), and it's entertaining enough. The highest notes carry over from <em>Part 1</em>, as Erivo and Grande are electric every time they share screentime — their big comical fight, which takes place immediately after a devastating cyclone of events, elicited rapturous engagement from the audience at my screening. And their duet \"For Good\" remains the Act II apex, a stirring meeting of the minds and declaration of friendship, even if lyricist Stephen Schwartz's prose leans toward clunk. (Two decades later, I'm still scratching my head at \"<a href=\"https://genius.com/23403224/Kristin-chenoweth-and-idina-menzel-for-good/Like-a-seed-dropped-by-a-skybird\" target=\"_blank\">Like a seed dropped by a skybird</a> /<a href=\"https://genius.com/37574158/Kristin-chenoweth-and-idina-menzel-for-good/In-a-distant-wood\" target=\"_blank\"> In a distant wood</a>.\" Huh???) If <em>For Good</em> doesn't soar quite as consistently as <em>Part 1</em>, this is at least partially by design. A song from the original show like the Wizard's vaudevillian ditty \"Wonderful\" — a more sinister retread of Glinda's far superior ode to the benefits of self-mythologizing, \"Popular\" — can't come close to matching Act I's abundance of bangers. (And unfortunately, the two new songs added here, Elphaba's \"No Place Like Home\" and Glinda's \"The Girl in the Bubble,\" add little beyond runtime.) Act II is also where the show's politics become indecipherable, or — to put it less generously — noncommittal. The story aims to challenge perceptions of what makes someone \"good\" or \"bad,\" but unlike its source material, Gregory Maguire's revisionist novel <em>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</em>, the new movie sands down those provocations to make certain characters more sympathetic than they are. But within the landscape of movie musicals, especially more recent examples, both <em>Wicked</em> movies serve as a triumph and tribute to creative fortitude. We've all laughed (and cringed) a lot about Erivo and Grande's peculiar antics throughout this never-ending publicity cycle, but there's something heartwarming about their deep commitment to the spirit of the material. Whatever your feelings about it, this is clearly a spectacle that's been made with love, and that's all for the better.",

    "title": "Eating just a handful of plastic can be fatal for marine animals, a study finds",
    "text": "Candy wrappers. Balloons. Grocery bags. Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 full garbage trucks worth of plastic gets dumped in the world's oceans. Scientists have long known that plastic waste is harmful to marine life. A new study, published in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, shows much plastic a marine animal has to eat for it to be lethal. \"What surprised me the most is how little it takes to become deadly,\" said Britta Baechler, a co-author of the study and director of Ocean Plastics Research at the Ocean Conservancy. Less than three sugar cubes' worth of plastic could kill an Atlantic puffin. Two baseballs' worth would do in a sea turtle. The equivalent of a soccer ball is enough to off a seal or dolphin. \"For seabirds, ingesting just six tiny pieces of rubber, each smaller than about the size of a pea, can result in a 90 percent chance of death,\" Baechler said. To determine the amounts and the kinds of plastic that marine animals were eating, researchers compiled the autopsy data of more than 10,000 deceased animals from 53 studies that had been conducted around the world. Among the victims: an albatross with an entire plastic bottle in its digestive tract. \"In another instance, there was a sperm whale that had died from eating an entire bucket that broken up in its gut and caused an obstruction,\" Baechler said. The study focused on macroplastics, debris that can be seen with the naked eye. It didn't look at microplastics, which can be microscopic and have been found even in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/06/06/729419975/microplastics-have-invaded-the-deep-ocean-and-the-food-chain\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the deepest parts</u></a> of the ocean. Nor did it look at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002612132/endangered-right-whales-are-shrinking-scientists-blame-commercial-fishing-gear\" target=\"_blank\"><u>entanglements</u></a>, the other primary way plastics impact marine animals. Greg Merrill, a researcher who focuses on plastics and marine animals and wasn't involved in the study, said scientists have known for years that marine animals are eating plastic, often because it looks like their natural food. \"Like if you are a sea turtle, for example, and you eat jellyfish, a plastic grocery bag is pretty similar,\" he said. \"It's fluid. It's not got a lot going on with it.\" He published a study last year that found whales, which use sonar to prey on food in the blackness of the deep ocean, can even be confused by plastic. The acoustic signature — the strength of the echo — a whale would hear coming off of a piece of plastic waste <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974912301254X?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\"><u>was similar</u></a> to what they'd hear coming off of their natural prey. \"So it kind of suggested that perhaps they're mistaking their acoustic cues and ingesting plastic that way,\" he said. The new study, Merrill said, is the kind of research that's needed to show policymakers and the general public how plastic is negatively affecting the health of marine animals. He and the authors of the new study said policy changes are needed internationally to reduce the production of plastic products — particularly single-use plastics, like soda bottles and food packaging, that have a long life after their single use. \"I think it's pretty obvious but plastic pollution is not just unsightly,\" Baechler said. \"It really does represent a serious immediate threat to marine life and we need urgent action.\"<br>",

    "title": "The latest Epstein emails reveal the powerful people who sought his counsel",
    "text": "New releases from Jeffrey Epstein's estate shine additional light on the array of powerful figures who kept ties to the disgraced financier after his criminal charges came to light. Spread throughout the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/12/nx-s1-5605582/epstein-files-release-trump-email-grijalva-massie\">roughly 23,000 documents</a> released by the House Oversight Committee last week, emails and texts show Epstein courted prominent politicos from both sides of the aisle, impressed academics and used his connections to push back on negative stories about his alleged crimes. Epstein's career as a wealthy financier who gave money to universities and other causes put him in many elite circles. Those circles did not entirely close to him after <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5478620/jeffrey-epstein-crimes-timeline-legal-case\" target=\"_blank\">he pleaded guilty</a> to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18 in 2008. Reading through the text messages and emails released, the people who consulted with Epstein rarely acknowledged the severity of the crimes that required him to register as a sex offender, though simply corresponding with Epstein does not implicate individuals in his criminal activities, convicted or accused. There's an <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JhmLArBNkM9ATNbzUKEEUJJtXYf03XjK/view\" target=\"_blank\">apparent letter of recommendation</a> for Epstein from linguist Noam Chomsky, calling him a \"highly valued friend,\" that recalled how Epstein connected him with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak — another frequent Epstein correspondent. \"Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which have repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues,\" the letter reads. There's advice Epstein gave to Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, about ways to build a far-right political movement overseas. \"If you are going to play here, you'll have to spend time, [E]urope by remote doesn't work,\" Epstein wrote in 2018. \"Lots and lots of face time and hand holding. Europe can be a wife not a mistress.\" Former Harvard University president and onetime Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is documented numerous times having intimate personal chats with Epstein, including asking for romantic advice and joking about women's intelligence. \"I yipped about inclusion,\" <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gGxFy7I2vTBom2IpUtAhEAZfG77FfFLk/view\" target=\"_blank\">wrote Summers in 2017</a>. \"I observed that half the IQ [in the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population....\" Summers resigned as Harvard's president in 2006 after arguing that women may be innately less capable in math and science. In the week since the latest Epstein emails release, he has resigned from the board of OpenAI and <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/11/20/summers-leaves-teaching-at-harvard/\" target=\"_blank\">abruptly left his teaching role</a> at Harvard, as the university <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/11/19/harvard-opens-investigation-into-summers-epstein/\" target=\"_blank\">announced a probe</a> of \"information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\" Summers isn't the only high-profile Democrat who found themself in varying degrees of Epstein's orbit. Kathryn Ruemmler, former White House counsel in the Obama administration and current chief legal officer for Goldman Sachs, messaged with Epstein before and during Trump's first term. \"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,\" she wrote in August 2015. \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\" Ruemmler told <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-calendar-cia-director-goldman-sachs-noam-chomsky-c9f6a3ff?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqeca-6-rAcciZ_Rf2MnfDLJPLPo1K5vab-42nC_rfPl35TdYq3CSHmT&gaa_ts=691e5239&gaa_sig=MrsBFSsJ5hwJ_Tq6hf1En60FDeQrVA6jHUx2U3MTJn-ibUNYPAGEP80tklMCIakp7kqqb9MiML_aR71ppQHUZA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> in 2023. <h3>More than a thousand mentions of Trump</h3> Trump promised to release the Epstein files on the campaign trail but largely stonewalled the effort this year since he returned to office, frequently calling the push for more transparency around the Epstein case a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. In a Wednesday Truth Social post announcing the signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump said Democrats were using the issue to distract from what he says are victories for his administration. \"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115579394833948106\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a>. The president has the authority to release the files without congressional action. Trump is a frequent subject of emails and text messages in the latest file tranche — well over a thousand different mentions — though mainly the subject of Epstein's near-obsession with his presidency, as the latter positioned himself as a Trump whisperer of sorts to his powerful associates. This week, after an abrupt reversal that led to the near-unanimous approval of the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text\" target=\"_blank\">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, the president has now called for Democrats mentioned in Epstein's communications to be investigated by the Justice Department. \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Other Republicans are going on the offensive too — highlighting revelations that Epstein was texting Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands during a <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/program/house-committee/michael-cohen-testimony-before-house-oversight-committee/522045\" target=\"_blank\">House Oversight Committee hearing</a> with Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen in 2019. Comparing the newly released messages with the video of the hearing, minutes after Epstein suggested Plaskett ask Cohen things about the Trump Organization, Plaskett posed similar questions. An effort to censure Plaskett in the House failed Tuesday. In a floor speech, Plaskett defended her actions as receiving information from a constituent and said it was \"not public knowledge at that time that he was under federal investigation.\" Amid the partisan finger-pointing around the Epstein files, some of Epstein's accusers are imploring the president not to make things partisan and focus on the other powerful people that they say haven't faced scrutiny — regardless of political party. <h3>What's next for the government's Epstein files?</h3> Within 30 days of Trump signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general is supposed to make \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" available in a searchable and downloadable format. That includes information that relates to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and \"individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities.\" There's also a focus on information regarding plea deals and decisions not to charge Epstein for other alleged crimes, as well as documents pertaining to his 2019 death by suicide in federal custody. Over the summer, the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1407001/dl?inline#:~:text=The%20files%20relating%20to%20Epstein,abuse%20material%20and%20other%20pornography.\" target=\"_blank\">FBI put out a memo</a> that said their files include \"a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence.\" Some of that includes photos and videos of Epstein's accusers, including minors, and disturbing material that will not be made public. The bill from Congress also says anything \"that would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution\" can be withheld or redacted, too. With Trump's ordering of the investigation into Democrats and financial institutions mentioned in the Epstein correspondence, it is unclear how much of the Justice Department's files will be released, to what extent they will be redacted and when they ultimately will be made public.<br>",

    "title": "Who are Afrikaners, the group at the center of Trump's dispute with South Africa?",
    "text": "When the G20 meeting kicks off in South Africa this weekend, one member country will be conspicuously absent: the United States. President Trump has decided that the U.S. will completely boycott the conference over what he considers the discriminatory treatment of Afrikaners by the South African government. They are the largest subset of the country's white minority, and Afrikaners ran South Africa's government for much of the 20th century and famously oversaw the racist system of apartheid until 1994. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5404667/south-africa-white-house-visit-ramaphosa-trump-tensions\" target=\"_blank\">repeated false claims</a> that the South African government is stealing land from white farmers and that there is an ongoing \"white genocide\" and \"extermination\" of Afrikaners, even taking the unprecedented step of offering refugee status to Afrikaners who want to flee. The first 59 Afrikaner refugees <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/12/nx-s1-5395067/first-group-afrikaner-refugees-arrive\" target=\"_blank\">arrived in the U.S.</a> in May. South African officials — including President Cyril Ramaphosa — have said Trump's claims are untrue and point to official government data showing that attacks against rural Afrikaners are rare, and that the country's Black majority bear the brunt of South Africa's rampant crime. Lindie Koorts, a historian at the University of Pretoria, said the false narrative has strained some of the progress made in post-apartheid South Africa, as Afrikaners whose ancestors perpetrated apartheid adjust to being a political minority. \"This is a minority that used to be protected by apartheid laws\" who now don't have the same job security and other economic benefits, said Koorts, who is an Afrikaner. \"It turns into something of existential dread, and that is very, very easily manipulated by the right wing.\" Here's what to know about the history of the Afrikaners. <h3>Who are Afrikaners?</h3> Afrikaners descend from colonists of mostly Dutch but also German and French origin who landed on the tip of Africa in the 17th century. Many passed through the <a href=\"https://sahistory.org.za/article/afrikaner\" target=\"_blank\">resupply station established</a> by the Dutch East India Company in present-day Cape Town, an ideal midpoint along the sea routes between Europe and Asia. Some Afrikaners later moved inland to form large farming colonies as their population grew on the continent. They also became known as Boers, which translates to \"farmers.\" Disputes between British colonists and the Boer settlers who spoke Afrikaans led to the <a href=\"https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/boer-war\" target=\"_blank\">Boer War</a>, which occurred at the turn of the century. The British forces won, but Afrikaners remained the majority of South Africa's white population after the war and gained control of South Africa's government in the early 20th century. In 1948, the Afrikaner-led government began to implement apartheid, a system of institutionalized racial segregation that benefited whites. Black people and other non-white South Africans were displaced and dispossessed. Apartheid ended in 1994 with the formation of a new, democratic government led by anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela. Apartheid helped consolidate wealth among several generations of South Africa's white minority, but its fall stripped them of their political power and has shifted race relations in the country, said Daniel Magaziner, a professor of African history at Yale University. \"Afrikaners — as white people — do quite well since 1994, but they do lose their political privileges, and so there is a rise in a sense of grievance and nostalgia for what has been lost since they lost their political control over the territory,\" he said. Magaziner said there remains in South Africa a strong cultural association of Afrikaners with farming, even though most Afrikaners now live in the suburbs or urban areas. \"But this idea that they're being targeted on farms is something that has a very big afterlife and is one of the reasons the Trump administration claims that these are people worthy — uniquely worthy — of being granted refugee status,\" he said. <h3>Some Afrikaners say they're facing discrimination</h3> Some Afrikaners say they are at risk of having their land stripped away or even facing physical violence and death because they are white, a claim that's been widely disputed by other Afrikaners, South African officials and Ramaphosa. Right-wing South African groups such as AfriForum <a href=\"https://www.artikels.afriforum.co.za/en/afriforum-requests-g20-countries-support-to-protect-property-rights-and-fight-farm-murders/\" target=\"_blank\">have attacked</a> a new federal land expropriation law, which replaces another law from the apartheid era. Critics say the new law lets the government take land from private citizens without compensation. <a href=\"https://www.parliament.gov.za/storage/app/media/Acts/2024/Act_13_of_2024_Expropriation_Act_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Under the law</a>, the government can only seize land without paying for it in limited circumstances, such as if the land is not in use. The government must also first attempt to strike a deal with the owner. Most commercial farmland in South Africa is still owned by the country's white minority, who make up about 8% of the population. AfriForum has also claimed there are widespread murders of white Afrikaner farmers, which it says law enforcement is doing too little to combat, though South Africa's government denies this.<strong> </strong>And the group has slammed <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5406758/shock-and-anger-in-south-africa-after-oval-office-ambush\" target=\"_blank\">politicians who've continued to sing</a> the apartheid-era song, \"Kill the Boer,\" something Ramaphosa said does not represent the policy of the government. AfriForum CEO <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkRp1_PiDsc\" target=\"_blank\">Kallie Kriel told Newzroom Afrika</a> that he wanted the South African government to condemn the song and recognize \"that we are seeing tortures that accompany these murders and declare it a priority crime.\" The claims have been boosted by some of Trump's allies in the U.S., including Elon Musk, who is from South Africa. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytJA8fwP728\" target=\"_blank\">dramatic Oval Office meeting</a> in May, Trump surprised Ramaphosa with a video montage and news clippings showing what Trump claimed was widespread violence and discrimination against white farmers. \"You do allow them to take land — when they take the land, they kill the white farmer, and when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them,\" Trump said to Ramaphosa, who immediately disputed it. This year the Trump administration began offering refugee status to Afrikaners, even as the administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/30/g-s1-95823/trump-administration-sets-lowest-ever-cap-on-refugee-admissions\" target=\"_blank\">cut the total number of refugees it would admit</a> to an all-time low. <h3>How South Africa is responding to claims of discrimination against whites</h3> Ramaphosa and other South African officials say attacks on farming communities are rare. National police data shows that there were <a href=\"https://dirco.gov.za/south-african-government-sets-record-straight-on-farm-crime/\" target=\"_blank\">six murders on farms</a> in South Africa during the first three months of this year. Most crime victims in South Africa <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5406419/a-south-african-journalist-on-trumps-claim-that-white-south-africans-are-victims\" target=\"_blank\">are Black</a> — not white — officials say. Of the six farm murders from January to March, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5xe7z0y0o\" target=\"_blank\">five of the victims were Black</a> and one was white. South Africa's police minister <a href=\"https://www.gov.za/news/speeches/minister-senzo-mchunu-release-20242025-fourth-quarter-crime-statistics-23-may-2025\" target=\"_blank\">said earlier this year</a> that farm murders have a history of being \"distorted and reported in an unbalanced way.\" Many Afrikaners <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/10/nx-s1-5603421/g20-afrikaners-trump-south-africa\" target=\"_blank\">have also disputed the idea</a> that they're being persecuted. A number of Afrikaner journalists, professors and others <a href=\"https://www.afrikanersvirsa.co.za/en\" target=\"_blank\">signed a public petition</a>, saying they rejected the idea that Afrikaners were \"victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa\" and didn't want to be \"pawns\" for American politicians. The group said South Africans of all races were facing a slew of problems. \"To cherry-pick white suffering and elevate it above others is dishonest and harmful,\" the petition reads. \"It feeds extremist ideologies that perpetuate division and have inspired real-world violence, including mass shootings.\" Koorts, one of the signatories, said the allegations of a \"white genocide\" are not true and that Afrikaners have had to do a lot of work to reckon with the violent and racist history of apartheid. \"What we now see is our story being taken out of context, being twisted for an American audience to make Americans fearful of multiculturalism, of multiracialism, of making Americans fearful of essentially becoming a white minority,\" she said. \"Don't. Please don't. That is not our story. That is a twisted version of our story.",

    "title": "Overdue jobs report shows employers added 119,000 jobs in September",
    "text": "Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. An <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">overdue report from the Labor Department</a> on Thursday showed U.S. employers added 119,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate inched up to 4.4%.  The report was released almost seven weeks behind schedule due to the government shutdown. And because the shutdown also delayed data-gathering, there won't be another jobs report until mid-December.   While the newly released information is a bit stale, it may offer some clues about the pace of hiring and firing this fall.  The report paints a mixed picture of the job market. Hiring was strongest in health care and hospitality in September, while factories and warehouses cut jobs. Downsizing in the federal government also continued during the month, though state and local governments continued to add jobs. Revised data shows job growth in July and August was even weaker than initially reported, with 33,000 fewer jobs added during those months.  For months now, employers have neither added many new workers nor handed out a lot of pink slips. But Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller worries that's about to change. Waller says his conversations with business leaders show the job market is close to stalling.  \"Four to six weeks ago, we were still in this kind of no-hire/no-fire mode,\" Waller told a group of economists in London this week.  Business leaders, he said, are \"starting to talk about layoffs. They're starting to plan for them in the future.\"  Amazon recently announced <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5588545/amazon-layoffs-corporate-workers-ai\" target=\"_blank\">14,000 job cuts</a>, and Verizon is cutting 15,000 workers.  Waller wants the Fed to cut interest rates again when policymakers meet next month, to boost demand and prop up the labor market. But <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20251029.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">minutes from the last Fed meeting</a>, released on Wednesday, show considerable disagreement among central bank policymakers.  Many members of the Fed's rate-setting committee suggested it would be appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the rest of the year, noting that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. That's partly due to President Trump's tariffs. And some Fed policymakers think the import taxes will continue to put upward pressure on goods prices well into next year.  Ordinarily, the Fed would have jobs numbers for October and November in hand before its next meeting.  But because of the government shutdown, those reports won't be released until after the meeting, and some of the October data won't come out at all. It's also uncertain when or if the October inflation report will be published. That said, Waller insists he and his colleagues are not flying blind. They've been listening to businesses like Target and McDonald's that say many of their customers are cautious with their spending right now. That could put more of a squeeze on the job market. \"You just go talk with firms that work with low- and middle-income households, they'll tell you point-blank, they're just not coming in the door,\" Waller said. \"And then these firms are not going to be hiring.\"  While government data on consumer spending has also been held up by the shutdown, anecdotal reports suggest only the wealthiest families are spending freely these days, buoyed in part by the gains in their stock portfolios.   The unemployment rate is driven by two forces: the number of jobs employers want to fill and the number of workers available to fill those jobs.  The Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has limited the number of foreign-born workers, at the same time many native-born baby boomers are retiring. Some analysts argue that the limited supply of workers is largely responsible for the slowdown in hiring.   Waller worries that the slowdown is driven more by a declining need for workers, which could result in higher unemployment in the months to come.    \"There's definitely a reduction of supply,\" he said. \"But to me that is masking the reduction in demand, and that's what I'm concerned about.",

    "title": "She cares for her aging parents full time. That requires taking care of herself, too",
    "text": "At age 43, Dawnita Brown made a life-changing pivot. She took leave from her secure government job, winnowed down her possessions, resolved her financial responsibilities, and in 2016, signed up for the Peace Corps. Volunteering in Eswatini was \"amazing,\" she says — so much so that she planned to extend her time abroad in a paid position with the Peace Corps after her service ended. She didn't know she was about to make another pivot. In 2018, her mom, Joan Cain, had a stroke in her brain stem. Brown rushed home to Baltimore, preparing herself to say goodbye. Instead, her mom recovered, but with a challenging prognosis. \"So, I became her proxy,\" Brown says, and she stayed by Cain's side through rehabilitation and nursing facilities. Eventually, concerns about the quality of her mother's care led Brown to step away from her job, take her mom home and care for her herself, full time. A huge number of today's 65-year-olds — more than <a href=\"https://acl.gov/ltc/basic-needs/how-much-care-will-you-need?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\" target=\"_blank\">two-thirds</a> — will likely need some kind of long-term care as they age, whether it's in-home care, assisted living or a nursing home. Those services can<a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/personal-finance/long-term-care-costs-options\" target=\"_blank\"> easily</a><a href=\"https://www.ltcfeds.gov/long-term-care/costs\" target=\"_blank\"> cost more each year</a> than what the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-282.html\" target=\"_blank\">average American</a> makes. And health insurers — both government and private — may not provide the necessary coverage. That leaves many people to rely on unpaid family caregivers whose care <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/financial-legal/unpaid-caregivers-provide-billions-in-care/\" target=\"_blank\">AARP valued at $600 billion</a> in 2021. That's more than half a trillion dollars worth of work done by people like Dawnita Brown. As a household, Brown makes caregiving financially feasible through a patchwork of coverage, including Medicare, supplemental insurance and her mom's pension. And she's debt free thanks to the work she put in readying herself for the Peace Corps. \"I haven't had a steady income in almost 10 years,\" says Brown. \"I haven't paid into retirement. But I don't want for anything.\" <h3><strong>'It's a gift'</strong></h3> Brown's<strong> </strong>home is warm and inviting, much like herself. The brick row house is tastefully appointed with meaningful family artifacts and photographs, meticulously clean without feeling sterile. On the day we visited, Brown had just returned from taking her dad, Bill Lee Brown, to physical therapy. She cares for him, too. Although Bill and Joan are not a couple, he moved into the home in 2024 after complications from his multiple myeloma diagnosis made it hard for him to live alone. So, while her mom's upstairs, her dad is downstairs. Between them, doing countless flights of stairs a day, Dawnita Brown is holding it all together. Meting out prescriptions, preparing meals, scheduling appointments and calling for help when it's more than one person can handle. Caregiving is a role she didn't expect, but one she has leaned all the way into. In 2021, Brown founded a community for fellow caregivers called the <a href=\"https://binticircle.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Binti Circle</a>. The name comes from the word for daughter in Swahili. \"I started Binti because it was the community I needed and did not have,\" she says. They meet monthly, have outings and events, all with the goal of making a difference in the lives of caregivers, reducing stress and providing safety in community. That way, Brown says, \"you have more skills and tools that you need for this gift of caregiving, because it's a gift to be able to care for your parent, even though it's hard.\" She says it was especially important to her to focus on Black daughters in caregiving roles. \"The daughter holds it together,\" says Brown, even in difficult situations. \"Looking at the fragility of your parent, processing the grief of losing the parent that you knew … that your mom doesn't know you.\" She adds, \"and you know what's even more challenging are those daughters that are caring for parents that did not parent them.\" In the Binti Circle, she has gathered \"a community of daughters that understand and can empathize, with no judgment.\" One of Binti's — and Brown's — core values is the importance of respite for caregivers. \"You know, most people think about self-care as nails and hair and massages,\" she says. Brown does those things, but taking care of herself also  includes regular doctor's appointments and therapy, and simpler things, too. \"It's breathing, just sometimes laying in my bed and breathing. And my devotionals, I always set the tone before I get out of bed.\" And as positive and motivated as Brown is, she does feel down sometimes. \"Yesterday I was feeling kind of yucky,\" she says. \"And so I got up and I found a … 'boost your mood' yoga workout.\" She has also built herself her own little getaway at home — an outdoor deck space furnished with thrifted and upcycled finds, succulents and a fire pit. She calls it her oasis. \"You are responsible for people,\" says Brown, so, \"if you're no good, they're no good. And so, that's why I work very hard to take care of myself.",

    "title": "Food banks, already strained, brace for prolonged demand",
    "text": "Lift carts whiz around corners and dart down long aisles, where 30-foot steel shelves full of boxes tower above. Beeping and buzzing, they push pallets of bananas and beans, canned goods and condiments to loading bays where trucks load up and deliver the food to local food pantries. With the holidays approaching, it's high season at the Greater Boston Food Bank. But this year is even busier than usual. A spike in demand from the recent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/01/nx-s1-5589143/the-shutdown-leaves-one-in-eight-americans-unsure-how-theyll-buy-food\" target=\"_blank\">disruption in SNAP food benefits</a> has yet to abate, even though <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5604788/snap-shutdown-anxiety-anger-may-linger\" target=\"_blank\">most SNAP payments have resumed</a>. And many expect the need for emergency food will continue to climb.  \"This is just the beginning,\" says warehouse lead Adrian James, driving out of the cooler with another full pallet. \"Who knows how bad it could get. That's the scary part.\" GBFB staff have been scrambling to keep up. CEO Catherine D'Amato says she's focusing on fundraising, hoping to buy more food, and is trying to \"sustain as much as possible for as long as possible.\" But, she says, \"This is not a matter of one and done.\" The GBFB is just one of many food banks and pantries around the nation feeling the strain, with no expectation of a reprieve anytime soon. Even if they catch up from this month's funding crisis, the Trump administration's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/03/nx-s1-5454841/house-republicans-trump-tax-bill-medicaid\" target=\"_blank\">Big Beautiful Bill Act </a>is set to shrink federal SNAP spending by billions of dollars over the next couple of years. At the same time, federal cuts to other safety net programs like Medicaid, affordable housing and health insurance subsidies are expected to compound the pressure on food banks and pantries that provide produce, meat, dairy and dry goods to millions of low-income U.S. residents. \"More people will lose benefits and they will increasingly need to turn to the charitable food sector, and that will turn need up again and again and again as those changes go into effect,\" says Linda Nageotte, president of Feeding America, a national network of food banks, pantries and meal programs. The result will feel \"like a tsunami, which is going to just wipe out people,\" says Harvard School of Public Health professor Sara Bleich, who worked on food security and nutrition for the Obama and Biden administrations. \"It's going to have a generational impact, and it's just heartbreaking.\" Food banks and pantries already are leaning more on help from state and local governments and private donations. But it's unrealistic, they say, to expect charitable organizations to scale up enough to compensate for cuts in federal programs, which historically have provided nine times what charitable food organizations deliver.  \"I'm anxious and I'm not sleeping,\" says Eric Cooper, CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank in Texas. He's trying to remain hopeful that demand will decrease, but that may be \"naive\" of him, he says, as he's \"still sending out more [food] than what's coming in.\" Cooper says his inventory is less than half what it usually is the week before Thanksgiving, and rising costs are making it difficult to restock. He locked in his holiday turkey purchase a year ago, he says, but prices went up so much, the vendor would no longer honor the deal. He's also had to hire extra drivers to pick up food, and he's paying staff overtime. Meanwhile, donations from his annual fall fundraising campaign, which usually carry him through the holidays, already are used up. \"We're just not going to be able to fill that need,\" he says. At the Facing Hunger Food Bank in Huntington, W.V., CEO Cynthia Kirkhart also isn't seeing a dip in demand. She too is paying overtime to her employees who worked 18 days straight without a day off. The work is taking an emotional toll. One day this month, cars were still lined up waiting for food at one of her mobile pantries when there was little left to offer. \"It came down to a bag of potatoes,\" Kirkhart recalls. There were two families in one car. Her staff offered the bag, and told them, \"This is all we have.\" They asked the families to split it. \"That's soul searing,\" Kirkhart says. Trump administration officials say the cuts to SNAP are intended ensure the program is \"sustainable for future generations\"  by cracking down on \"proven cases of waste, fraud and abuse.\" In a statement to NPR, a spokesperson said, \"The President is doing something about it.\"  Back at the Greater Boston Food Bank, Richard Green, director of the Saint Matthew's pantry in Dorchester, heaves big bags of food into a box truck. \"We can't keep up with it,\" he says between throws. Green has been volunteering for the pantry for a decade, and calls feeding the hungry his \"mission.\" He doesn't buy into the doomsday predictions, nor does he blame the federal government. The government, he says, is just doing its job. \"The government has to be vigilant and make sure that everybody that's on SNAP is eligible to be on SNAP,\" Green says. \"You'd be a fool if you didn't think that a lot of people would be taking advantage of it.\" Still, he doesn't expect demand will let up any time soon. He's working on setting up new systems to make it easier for his pantry to take donations online. <br>",

    "text": "<em>NPR's series </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-89066/cost-of-living\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cost of Living: The Price We Pay</em></a><em> is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/g-s1-88442/cost-of-living-prices\" target=\"_blank\"><em>this form</em></a><em> to share your story with NPR.</em> <strong>What's the item: </strong> College Tuition <strong>How has the price changed? </strong> Over the last 30 years — average tuition for both public and private four year colleges <a href=\"https://research.collegeboard.org/trends/college-pricing\" target=\"_blank\"><u>has essentially doubled</u></a> after adjusting for inflation. It really does feel like tuition is always rising. I found a <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/08/archives/harvard-tuition-up-200.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>article from 1970</u></a> noting that tuition at Harvard University for the coming year was going to jump – by $200 – from $2,400 a year to $2,600 (which would be about $21,000 today when adjusted for inflation). Next year, the tuition at <a href=\"https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/tuition-and-fees#hcol\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Harvard will be</u></a> more than $59,000, though when you add in things like housing and food, that number price tag jumps to more than $86,000. But many families aren't actually paying those high sticker prices. Instead, students get financial aid or merit aid, and end up paying a lower cost, called the net price. Net price is still up when you compare with two decades ago, but <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240730_TPC_Looney_CollegeCosts1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>in recent years the trend is more flat</u></a>. Or, in some cases, falling. Data from the College Board's annual report tracking college prices shows that tuition for in-state students at public four-year colleges peaked in 2012, and has since declined. Judith Scott-Clayton, a professor of economics and education at Columbia University's Teachers College has been writing about the difference between those $100,000 price tags and what families really pay <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/college-is-cheaper-than-you-think/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>for more than two decades</u></a>. \"College is expensive and no one is saying it's not a challenge,\" she says \"But it's also important to acknowledge that it's not a hopeless case.\" <strong>Why has the sticker price gone up so much?</strong> There are many factors behind this. At public institutions, a big factor for many years was declining state funding; as legislatures reduced that funding, colleges were forced to raise tuition to make up for it. In recent years, though, state funding has rebounded somewhat. The COVID-19 pandemic saw a huge drop in enrollment at colleges, so in some places that increase of state investment combined with fewer people going to college, meant more money per student. There's also administrative bloat at some schools. And some experts blame student loans, though <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/13/672952507/does-more-federal-aid-raise-tuition-costs-not-for-most-students-research-says\" target=\"_blank\"><u>there is mixed research on this</u></a>. Since 2007, the amount of student debt held by Americans has more than tripled, to roughly $1.6 trillion. As the ease of obtaining student loans increased, some researchers say, colleges absorbed that money in tuition increases. Other experts point to rising costs, and competition: There are always new fancy buildings to build, and more staff to hire. Also, having a high price tag dictates prestige. And there are wealthy families willing to pay those high prices: At Harvard — 40% of the incoming class <a href=\"https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.harvard.edu/dist/6/210/files/2025/06/HarvardUniversity_CDS_2024-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>pays full price</u></a> — they don't get any financial help. <strong>The actual costs are often murky.</strong> Some families pay one thing, others pay another price. And no college seems to cost the same. The market is opaque, and that's another reason tuition is high: Families often don't know until the end of the admission process how much these schools will cost them. Which means,<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/642287824/confused-by-your-college-financial-aid-letter-you-re-not-alone\" target=\"_blank\"><u> it's very hard to price shop</u></a>, comparing one school's cost to another. \"That means colleges don't really compete on price with one another because students can't see the price up front,\" says Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"They can't play different colleges' pricing offers against one another the way they could in a normal market.\" <strong>Some solutions</strong> There have been efforts – including in Congress – to standardize financial aid offer letters, to allow more comparison between colleges. Another solution the Trump administration has touted is to freeze tuition. One example of a university holding down costs by freezing tuition is Purdue University. In 2013, Purdue locked undergraduate tuition at around $9,000 a year for in-state students, and $28,000 for out-of-state. The move brought a lot of skepticism at the time, but the freeze is still in place – <a href=\"https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/2025/Q2/trustees-approve-2026-budget-frozen-base-tuition-for-main-campus-and-no-increase-for-indiana-residents-at-purdue-northwest-and-purdue-fort-wayne-for-2025-26-2026-27/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>more than a decade later</u></a>. \"We've increased tuition revenue without raising prices,\" says Chris Ruhl, Purdue's chief financial officer and treasurer. How? \"By serving more students,\" he explains – both in-state students and out-of-state students from within the U.S. Also, \"we've grown other revenue streams,\" he adds, \"and then, we've been laser-focused on costs.\" Ruhl points out that, historically, colleges set their budgets first, then set tuition at a level that would cover all the expenses. Purdue's freeze, he says, flips that model: They start with tuition and then adjust revenue goals and spending to meet what the university can afford. <strong>There are very affordable options </strong> One thing to note is that tuition varies widely, from college to college and from state to state. In Florida, for example, the average tuition for in-state students is about $5,000 a year and t<a href=\"https://www.collegetuitioncompare.com/trends/?state=FL\" target=\"_blank\"><u>hat's remained constant for about 10 years</u></a>. And in many places, community colleges offer an affordable alternative, with the option to transfer later to a four year school. And, for low-income students, a <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Federal Pell Grant </u></a>could end up making that tuition free, or nearly so.<br>",

    "text": "MIAMI — U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida has been indicted on charges accusing her of stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds and using some of the money to aid her 2021 campaign, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The Democrat is accused of stealing Federal Emergency Management Agency overpayments that her family health care company had received through a federally funded COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, federal prosecutors said. A portion of the money was then funneled to support her campaign through candidate contributions, prosecutors allege. \"Using disaster relief funds for self-enrichment is a particularly selfish, cynical crime,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"No one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain. We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.\" A phone message left at Cherfilus-McCormick's Washington office was not immediately returned. Cherfilus-McCormick was first elected to Congress in 2022 in the 20th District, representing parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, in a special election after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021. In December 2024, a Florida state agency sued a company owned by Cherfilus-McCormick's family, saying it overcharged the state by nearly $5.8 million for work done during the pandemic and wouldn't give the money back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management said it made a series of overpayments to Trinity Healthcare Services after hiring it in 2021 to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations. The agency says it discovered the problem after a single $5 million overpayment drew attention. Cherfilus-McCormick was the CEO of Trinity at the time. The Office of Congressional Ethics said in a January report that Cherfilus-McCormick's income in 2021 was more than $6 million higher than in 2020, driven by nearly $5.75 million in consulting and profit-sharing fees received from Trinity Healthcare Services. In July, the House Ethics Committee unanimously voted to reauthorize an investigative subcommittee to examine allegations involving Cherfilus-McCormick.",

    "title": "What's next now that Trump has signed a bill releasing the Epstein files",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has signed a bill to compel the Justice Department to make public its case files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a potentially far-reaching development in a yearslong push by survivors of Epstein's abuse for a public reckoning. Both the House and Senate passed the bill this week with overwhelming margins after Trump reversed course on his monthslong opposition to the bill and indicated he would sign it. Now that the bill has been signed by the president, there's a 30-day countdown for the Justice Department to produce what's commonly known as the Epstein files. \"This bill is a command for the president to be fully transparent, to come fully clean, and to provide full honesty to the American people,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Wednesday. Schumer added that Democrats were ready to push back if they perceive that the president is doing anything but adhering to \"full transparency.\" In a social media post Wednesday as he announced he had signed the bill, Trump wrote, \"Democrats have used the 'Epstein' issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories.\" The swift, bipartisan work in Congress this week was a response to the growing public demand that the Epstein files be released, especially as attention focuses on his connections to global leaders including Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has already been stripped of his royal title as Prince Andrew over the matter, and many others. There is plenty of public anticipation about what more the files could reveal. Yet the bill will most likely trigger a rarely seen baring of a sprawling federal investigation, also creating the potential for unintended consequences. <h3>What does the bill do?</h3> The bill compels Attorney General Pam Bondi to release essentially everything the Justice Department has collected over multiple federal investigations into Epstein, as well as his longtime confidante and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for luring teenage girls for the disgraced financier. Those records total around 100,000 pages, according to a federal judge who has reviewed the case. It will also compel the Justice Department to produce all its internal communications on Epstein and his associates and his 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell as he awaited charges for sexually abusing and trafficking dozens of teenage girls. The legislation, however, exempts some parts of the case files. The bill's authors made sure to include that the Justice Department could withhold personally identifiable information of victims, child sexual abuse materials and information deemed by the administration to be classified for national defense or foreign policy. \"We will continue to follow the law with maximum transparency while protecting victims,\" Bondi told a news conference Wednesday when asked about releasing the files. The bill also allows the Justice Department to withhold information that would jeopardize active investigations or prosecutions. That's created some worry among the bill's proponents that the department would open active investigations into people named in the Epstein files in order to shield that material from public view. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump loyalist who has had a prominent split with Trump over the bill, said Tuesday that she saw the administration's compliance with the bill as its \"real test.\" \"Will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?\" she asked. In July, the FBI said in a memo regarding the Epstein investigation that, \"we did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" But Bondi last week complied with Trump's demands and ordered a federal prosecutor to investigate Epstein's ties to the president's political foes, including Clinton. Still, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who sponsored the bill, said \"there's no way they can have enough investigations to cover\" all of the people he believes are implicated in Epstein's abuse. \"And if they do, then good,\" he added. The bill also requires the Justice Department to produce reports on what materials it withheld, as well as redactions made, within 15 days of the release of the files. It stipulates that officials can't withhold or redact anything \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\" <h3>Who could be named?</h3> There's a widely held expectation that many people could be named in case files for investigations that spanned over a decade — and some concern that just because someone is named, that person would be assumed guilty or complicit. Epstein was a luminary who kept company with heads of state, influential political figures, academics and billionaires. The release of his emails and messages by a House Oversight Committee investigation last week has already shown his connections with — and private conversations about — Trump and many other high-powered figures. Yet federal prosecutors follow carefully constructed guidelines about what information they produce publicly and at trial, both to protect victims and to uphold the fairness of the legal system. House Speaker Mike Johnson raised objections to the bill on those grounds this week, arguing that it could reveal unwanted information on victims as well as others who were in contact with investigators. Still, Johnson did not actually try to make changes to the bill and voted for it on the House floor. For the bill's proponents, a public reckoning over the investigation is precisely the point. Some of the survivors of trafficking from Epstein and Maxwell have sought ways to name people they accuse of being complicit or involved, but fear they will face lawsuits from the men they accuse. Massie said that he wants the FBI to release the reports from its interviews with the victims. Those reports typically contain unvetted information, but Massie said he is determined to name those who are accused. He and Greene have offered to read the names of those accused on the House floor, which would shield their speech from legal consequences. \"We need names,\" Massie said.",

    "title": "Trump administration seeks to roll back protections for imperiled species and habitat",
    "text": "BILLINGS, Mont. — President Trump's administration moved Wednesday to roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live, reviving a suite of changes to Endangered Species Act regulations from the Republican's first term that were blocked under former Democratic President Joe Biden. The proposed changes include the elimination of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \"blanket rule\" that automatically protects animals and plants when they are classified as threatened. Government agencies instead would have to craft species-specific rules for protections, a potentially lengthy process. The administration's announcement answers longstanding calls for revisions to the Endangered Species Act from Republicans in Congress and industries including oil and gas, mining and agriculture. Critics argue the landmark 1973 environmental law has been wielded too broadly, to the detriment of economic growth. But environmentalists warned the changes could cause yearslong delays in efforts to save species such as the monarch butterfly, Florida manatee, California spotted owl and North American wolverine. \"We would have to wait until these poor animals are almost extinct before we can start protecting them. That's absurd and heartbreaking,\" said Stephanie Kurose with the Center for Biological Diversity. Scientists and government agencies say extinctions are accelerating globally because of habitat loss and other pressures. Trump has made oil and gas production a centerpiece of his presidency and sought to strip away environmental regulations that impede development. Other pending proposals from the administration would revise the definition of \"harm\" under the Endangered Species Act and potentially bypass species protections for logging projects in national forests and on public lands. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement that the administration was restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent while respecting \"the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources.\" \"These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense,\" Burgum said in a statement. Another proposed change tasks officials with analyzing economic impacts when deciding whether habitat is critical to a species' survival. <h3>Case of lizard shows potential outcome of proposals</h3> The case of the Yarrow's spiny lizard in the Southwest exemplifies the potential consequences of the proposals. Rapidly warming temperatures have ravaged a population of the lizard in Arizona's Mule Mountains, pushing the reptiles further up the mountainsides toward the highest peaks and possibly toward extinction. A petition filed Wednesday seeks protections for the lizard and the designation of critical habitat. Advocates say analyzing the economic impacts could delay protections. Designating critical habitat could be another hurdle because the primary threat to this population of spiny lizard is climate change. \"We think that the species should be listed as endangered. In fact, we are somewhat shocked that it is not already extinct,\" said John Wiens, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, who co-authored the petition. The Interior Department was sued over the blanket protection rule in March, by the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. The two groups argued the rule was illegal and discouraged states and landowners from assisting in species recovery efforts. Species designated as \"threatened\" under the rule automatically qualify for the same protections as those with the more severe designation of \"endangered.\" PERC Vice President Jonathan Wood said Wednesday's proposal was a \"necessary course correction.\" \"This reform acknowledges the blanket rule's unlawfulness and puts recovery back at the heart of the Endangered Species Act,\" Wood said. <h3>Proposals would undermine protections, critic says</h3> Kristen Boyles with the environmental law firm Earthjustice said the changes undermine protections even more than in Trump's first term. That includes allowing the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to not count negative effects on species if those impacts are not regulated by the agencies themselves, Boyles said. \"The Services are required to prevent harmful consequences to species, not ignore them,\" she said. Trump officials during his first term also rolled back protections for individual species including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf. The spotted owl decision was reversed in 2021 after officials said Trump's political appointees used faulty science to justify opening millions of acres of West Coast forest to potential logging. Protections for wolves across most of the U.S. were restored by a federal court in 2022. The Endangered Species Act protects more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. It is credited with helping save the bald eagle, California condor and scores more animals and plants from extinction since Republican President Richard Nixon signed it into law.",

    "title": "Curaçao to Cape Verde: Small nations make big World Cup history",
    "text": "BOGOTA, Colombia — Few stories capture the magic of next year's <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026\" target=\"_blank\">FIFA World Cup </a>quite like Curaçao—a small Caribbean nation that has defied history, geography, and every expectation to reach the biggest stage in global soccer. With 42 of the 48 spots to compete in the 2026 World Cup now filled, the tournament is already shaping up to be a historic one, with several other underdog nations defying the odds to play at the event jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada next summer. While several major European, Africa and Asian soccer teams failed to qualify, including Nigeria, China, India, Greece, Serbia, and Hungary, multiple small nations have made global headlines by securing their place in next summer's competition, some for the first time. From Curaçao to Cape Verde, here is a look at some of the minnows who have earned a spot in the 2026 World Cup <h3>Curaçao</h3> Until now, the tiny Caribbean nation of Curaçao was better known for its turquoise-blue liqueur and sun-soaked beaches than for its soccer feats. But after drawing 0–0 with Jamaica on Tuesday, the former Dutch colony set a historic record by becoming the least populous country ever to reach the FIFA World Cup. Home to roughly <a href=\"https://www.cbs.cw/population\" target=\"_blank\"><u>150,000</u></a> people and located in the southern Caribbean just off the coast of Venezuela— it has surpassed Iceland as the smallest country to compete in the world's most prestigious soccer tournament. As a point of comparison, the World Cup final next summer will be played at the <a href=\"https://www.metlifestadium.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>MetLife stadium in New Jersey</u></a>, which has a capacity of 82,500 – more than half of Curaçao's population. To overcome the limitations of having a small population, Curaçao, a Dutch Caribbean nation, has mostly recruited players born in the Netherlands for its World Cup squad. The country became an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 2010 following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. \"Curaçao, like quite a few examples of smaller nations, have been good at tapping into the diaspora, ringing anyone who might have a distant relative connected to their country,\" explained Carl Worswick, an independent sports journalist and soccer specialist. <h3>Haiti</h3> Another underdog to reach the international tournament is Haiti, which has qualified for the first time since 1974, despite a raft of obstacles at home; the Caribbean nation is facing an acute security and humanitarian crisis which has impacted every sector of society, including football players. \"They've been living the crisis in full scale… They haven't been able to train or play in Haiti for years because of the gang violence,\" said Harold Isaac, a Haitian journalist based in Port-au-Prince. Haiti's coach since 2024, Frenchman Sebastien Migne, has never been to the country, where gangs control 90% of the capital city Port-au-Prince. Given the turmoil that many Haitians live with, the World Cup qualification has been a glimmer of hope, according to Isaac: \"This really came as a kind of unimaginable boon, morally, for the country.\" <h3>Cape Verde</h3> Cape Verde, a small Atlantic archipelago off the coast of West Africa, qualified for the World Cup for the first time last month when it beat the southern African nation of Eswatini 3-0. Before Curaçao qualified, Cape Verde had been the second-least populous country to reach the World Cup, with a population of roughly 600,000. The former Portuguese colony has also recruited from its diaspora, with its team notably featuring Center-back Roberto Lopes, who was born in Ireland to an Irish mother and Cape Verdean father. <h3>Panama</h3> Another small nation, Panama, will be making a return to the World Cup after its 2018 debut at the tournament. The Central American nation of four and a half million people beat El Salvador Tuesday to earn its place in the competition. In 2018, Panama finished at the bottom of its group with zero points and will now have a chance at redemption. A key reason that several small nations in the Americas have qualified for the tournament is because Canada, Mexico and the U.S. are hosting it. As hosts, these countries automatically qualify, leaving more room for other nations in the ﻿﻿﻿Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football to win a spot. <h3>What's next for the minnows?</h3> While social media is flooded with videos of street parties and parades as countries celebrate their qualifications, the road to the World Cup is still long. \"I think everyone assumes that, brilliant, this can only be a good thing… but there is a lesson to be learned, it's not always positive,\" said soccer expert Worswick. He stressed the importance of national Football Associations investing funds into their players and teams, citing high-profile scandals that have marred some countries' World Cup debuts. Worswick explained that while qualifying for the World Cup puts a country on the map, it often also brings complicated issues surrounding team finances, preparation, and pressure at home. But for countries like Haiti, just qualifying may be enough: \"The people are suffering and they've been suffering for years,\" says Isaac, \"and they're just asking for hope, and this is what the team brought them.\"<br>",

    "text": "TOKYO — Firefighters and army helicopters battled a fire Wednesday that burned through a neighborhood of old wooden houses in a fishing town in southwestern Japan, killing one person, injuring another and forcing more than 170 people to evacuate. A man in his 70s was unaccounted for and firefighters later found a body, possibly of the missing man, and a woman in her 50s suffered a minor injury, the Oita prefecture disaster response team said. Dozens of fire engines and more than 200 firefighters were mobilized to battle the fire, which was not still fully under control more than a day after it started. The Ground Self-Defense Force dispatched two UH-1 army helicopters to assist. It may take a few more days before the fire is completely extinguished, town mayor Shinya Adachi told reporters after he visited the devastated neighborhood Wednesday. At least 170 homes have been damaged or burned down, the disaster response team said. The residential section struck by the fire is close to the coastal area of Oita known for mackerel fishing but not near the prefecture's popular hot spring resorts, called onsen, and historic, thatched-roof homes. The fire started during strong winds Tuesday evening near a fishing port in the Saganoseki district of Oita City on the southern main island of Kyushu. The blaze spread to a forest, affecting about 4.9 hectares (12 acres), the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said. There was an advisory for strong wind when the fire broke out. A firefighter told the Kyodo News Agency that fire fighting operation was hampered by narrow backstreets where fire engines could not enter. There were also abandoned homes in the rapidly aging and shrinking neighborhood, Kyodo said. The local network YTV noted that the narrow alleyways where the fire burned had old wooden houses. The fires spread quickly as a strong wind was \"blowing in all directions,\" a 59-year-old office worker told Kyodo as she recalled how the fire started Tuesday evening. Authorities are still investigating the fire's cause and how it spread, the FDMA said. Japanese television footage showed smoke rising from swaths of land filled with destroyed and damaged houses, though orange flames were no longer visible by midday Wednesday. The Oita prefecture said about 260 homes remained without electricity Wednesday afternoon. A resident told Kyodo that she quickly fled without many of her belongings because the fire \"spread in the blink of an eye.\" Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi posted a statement on X offering sympathy for those affected by the fire and pledged to \"provide maximum support.",

    "text": "<em>Far-Flung Postcards is a weekly series in which NPR's international team shares moments from their lives and work around the world.</em> Matryoshka dolls are a Russian folk art tradition dating back over a century. These hollow wooden figurines, shaped like squat bowling pins and painted ornately, come in sets that nest neatly one inside another. On a recent visit to northeastern China, I learned that many nesting dolls are made in one small township here — Yimianpo. It's about 125 miles from the border with Russia.  In the late 19th century, when the Russian Empire started <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-Eastern-Railway\" target=\"_blank\">building rail lines</a> to expand eastward, Yimianpo <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-02/08/c_137806353.htm\" target=\"_blank\">was a key stop</a>. The matryoshka — or <em>tao wa</em>, as they're called in China — followed.  A workshop owner invited me into his carving shop. There, amid thigh-high piles of wood shavings, I watched an artisan hammer a block of linden wood from a nearby forest onto a lathe. Wielding gouges and chisels that looked like diabolical fire pokers, he shaped the wood into a rounded silhouette. Then he carved another.

    "title": "Epstein survivor recalls 'a collective sense of joy' when Congress voted to release DOJ files",
    "text": "Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation on Tuesday forcing the Justice Department to release its files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Liz Stein, an Epstein survivor and an anti-trafficking advocate, was at the Capitol when the Epstein bill passed. “There was a collective sense of joy,&#8221; Stein told <em>Here &amp; Now</em>&#8216;s Elissa Nadworny. &#8220;When we were at the House, we had no idea what would be coming after. So, it was really just a day that I think we&#8217;re all trying to still wrap our heads around.” <h3>5 questions with Liz Stein</h3> <strong>What are you hearing from the other victims in this moment?</strong> “I think that many of us have concerns about this. Some of us are feeling a little bit of whiplash. The position that the current administration has taken has been flip-flopping back and forth and back and forth. And so, I think that we are cautiously optimistic about this, but we definitely have feelings about it.” <strong>How has this become politicized?</strong> “Well, I say very frequently that this isn&#8217;t a political issue. This has been ongoing throughout five administrations of both political parties. What we&#8217;re looking at but what we&#8217;re not seeing clearly is that this is a crime and it&#8217;s a crime of sex trafficking. We are victims of a crime. These people are predators, and they preyed on young girls and women, and I don&#8217;t think that any of us in society, regardless of where our political loyalty lies, could stand for that. And I think that we&#8217;re being distracted by making this a political issue when it&#8217;s not.” <strong>How did you realize you had been trafficked after Epstein was arrested in 2019?</strong> “I consider myself to be a reasonably well-educated person. I&#8217;ve always felt very strongly about women&#8217;s rights, but I had misconceptions about what sex trafficking was. And so when Epstein was arrested in 2019, I really didn&#8217;t understand. I thought in my mind, I was thinking, ‘But they were my friends. I wasn&#8217;t trafficked. I wasn&#8217;t a girl in Florida. I wasn&#8217;t on the island.&#8217; I knew them in New York. I traveled with them a little, but I didn&#8217;t, you know, I didn&#8217;t fit with what the media was talking about. And so that left me confused, you know, trying to process what had happened to me. And when I did that, and I actually understood what trafficking was and what it looked like, it was exactly what happened to me. And that made me so angry that I just felt like I had to become a part of the movement. “When you&#8217;re looking at a sex trafficking operation, you have, kind of, three components. You have the pimp or the person who&#8217;s supplying the people to be exploited. You have the buyers or the johns or the men who are receiving the services of the people who are being exploited, and you have the people who are being exploited, right? And we&#8217;re really our attention’s being refocused because these men — these men who are perpetrators — have these positions of power, and it can be almost unthinkable to us that these people that we respect in society could do these horrible things.” <strong>Do you think the Justice Department will actually release the files?</strong> “I think that we&#8217;re going to have to wait and see. So much of this case has been completely unpredictable for us, but I can say that we&#8217;re really hopeful and that any time that we move closer to seeing what actually happened, we&#8217;re getting closer to having justice.” <strong>What does justice look like to you and the other survivors?</strong> “That&#8217;s a question that we get a lot, and it&#8217;s a really hard question to answer. I think justice can come in a lot of different forms for us. I think we&#8217;ve seen pieces of justice, but ultimately, I think that we all want to see whoever was involved in these crimes be held accountable.” ____ <em><a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/samantha-raphelson\">Samantha Raphelson</a> produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/catherine-welch\">Catherine Welch</a>.

    "title": "Take it cheesy: Chef Tini breaks down her viral Thanksgiving mac and cheese recipe",
    "text": "Thanksgiving is so close, you can almost taste the gravy on the table. If you haven&#8217;t gone to the store to secure your cavatappi pasta noodles, you&#8217;re going to want to run right now. Why those noodles specifically? Well, they are an essential part of the internet&#8217;s favorite Thanksgiving <a href=\"https://cheftineke.substack.com/p/tinis-famous-mac-and-cheese\">mac and cheese recipe.</a> The recipe, created and shared by TikTok chef <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tinekeyounger\">Tineke &#8220;Tini” Younger</a>, went viral in 2023. Two years later, the recipe has become the go-to for home chefs bringing mac and cheese to Thanksgiving festivities. Younger says she never expected the recipe to become a classic. “I didn&#8217;t think it would pop off as much as it did because it&#8217;s just mac and cheese … but it&#8217;s a way to get people in the kitchen,” Younger said.  “And people that don&#8217;t usually cook and they&#8217;re like, ‘I nailed the mac and cheese.’ So, it&#8217;s a reward for me.” <em>Find the recipe <a href=\"https://cheftineke.substack.com/p/tinis-famous-mac-and-cheese\">here</a>.</em> <strong>Where did the recipe come from? Did you develop it from a family recipe? Did you learn it at school?</strong> “I&#8217;ve always liked mac and cheese … and it kind of was just a bunch of experimenting and stuff that I learned in culinary school. And then the restaurants that I worked in, I was using whole milk instead of evaporated milk. And then I learned what exactly evaporated milk was in school. It&#8217;s regular milk, but 60% of the water is evaporated. So you don&#8217;t have to really sit there and let it simmer. You get the creaminess with that the extra water and then the cavatappi pasta.” “I use cavatappi because you want the cream to get in the hole. And people laugh at that because it sounds a little dirty, but it&#8217;s like, no, that&#8217;s really why I picked it. Because the cream gets in the hole and you bite into the pasta, and it&#8217;s just more flavor for you.” <strong>There has been a lot of frenzy over this mac and cheese. Some people are upset it doesn&#8217;t work out exactly how they envision, even though maybe they didn&#8217;t actually follow the recipe that closely. It is interesting that it sounds like there are maybe some cons to having a food recipe go viral.</strong> “Yeah, I feel like that&#8217;s really with any recipe that goes super, super viral, people are always going to have issues with it.  Some people don&#8217;t follow the directions, so they’ll blame the person that made it, even though it&#8217;s a user error. But I feel like the positive definitely outweighs the negative. The amount of people that … come up to me still, though. I never knew how to cook before, like making your recipes, before making this mac and cheese. But I nailed this mac and cheese, and I became more confident in the kitchen, so that definitely outweighs the negatives.” <strong>For people who are going to make it this year, what are the most common missteps to avoid?</strong> “One, the big one last year was some people were messing up the roux, so their mac and cheese came out grainy and gritty. That could be because you don&#8217;t have your heat the correct temperature. I like to do medium just because if it&#8217;s too high, you&#8217;ll burn your flour, and you don&#8217;t fully cook it out all the way, so you&#8217;ll have clumps, and we don&#8217;t like that. So you really want to take your time with everything with the roux. “Another one is people kept saying it was soupy, and it’s because they&#8217;re dumping the whole can of evaporated milk and heavy cream in without letting it simmer and mix … You have to add it little by little and let it get thick. So you just have to take your time with it. “And then another reason why, if it&#8217;s creamy and gritty, is because your heat is too high when you add the cheese, and your cheese will separate, and it will curdle. So you just have to take it slow. Don&#8217;t rush it. I mean, it only takes, max 20 minutes to assemble. So, yeah, you just got to take it slow.” <strong>Do we really have to shred all the cheese by hand?</strong> “You don&#8217;t have to do it by hand. You can use KitchenAid; they’ll have a shredding tool or a food processor, but you have to shred the cheese yourself. You cannot use pre-shredded. That is my number one thing. Do not use pre-shredded because there&#8217;s a coating on it. They&#8217;ll use potato starch on top of the shredded cheese in the stores just so it doesn&#8217;t clump up together. Don&#8217;t do that in the mac and cheese recipe. It&#8217;s not going to melt with how you want it to and it&#8217;s going to be grainy and it&#8217;s just not going to be creamy.” <em>This interview was edited for clarity. </em> ____ <em><a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/kalyani-saxena\">Kalyani Saxena</a> produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/todd-mundt\">Todd Mundt</a>.

    "title": "'The Mighty Nein' TV show is another 'Dungeons & Dragons' adaptation from 'Critical Role'",
    "text": "An epic, livestreamed “Dungeons &amp; Dragons” game has again become the basis for a new animated show. “Every step of this journey has been unexpected,” said <a href=\"https://critrole.com/members/sam-riegel/\">Sam Riegel</a>, original “Critical Role” cast member who reprised his role for the new series, “The Mighty Nein.” “The best thing we&#8217;ve ever done in our lives is making these shows and telling these stories and inspiring other people to play games like we do.” “The Mighty Nein” premieres on Prime Video Wednesday — the <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2022/01/27/legend-of-vox-machina-critical-role\">second animated “Critical Role” adaptation</a> on the platform. “It took several years for us to even dream up this potentially becoming an animated series, and it&#8217;s only because of the support of our audience from a crowd-sourcing campaign,” said <a href=\"https://critrole.com/members/travis-willingham/\">Travis Willingham</a>, cast member and CEO of Critical Role Productions. “Because of that, we get to go out and find true nerds like [showrunner] Tasha Huo that have a perspective on how we can economize and change things up not just for our existing audience, but for anybody that&#8217;s coming to ‘Critical Role’ for the very first time.” <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4409961/\">Huo</a>, a “Critical Role” fan known for <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81361105\">her animated adaptation</a> of the “Tomb Raider” video game franchise, had her work cut out for her. Thankfully, her team had plenty of experience condensing hundreds of hours of a livestreamed role-playing game into a TV series. “We know how the process works and we know storywise what does and doesn&#8217;t work,” said Huo. “I think we&#8217;re perfecting our craft in ‘The Mighty Nein,’ which is awesome to see.” <strong>Where did the name “The Mighty Nein” come from?</strong> <strong>Travis Willingham</strong>: “‘The Mighty Nein’ is a beautiful play on words. We have a character in the show, Caleb Widogast, who speaks Zemnian. And because his creator, <a href=\"https://critrole.com/members/liam-obrien/\">Liam O&#8217;Brien</a>, was a foreign exchange student and a fan of the German language younger in life, he decided to make Zemnian in our world a more classic or old version of German. “And we have to tip our hat to the amazing Sam Riegel, who on a text thread famously shared amongst the cast, he said, ‘What about The Mighty Nein?’ And it&#8217;s so trollish. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense. There certainly aren&#8217;t nine of us, and it causes just enough eyebrows to go up when people say it that we knew it was perfect.” <strong>Sam, you play Nott the Brave, a female goblin thief. It seems obvious that you&#8217;re not a goblin.</strong> <strong>Sam Riegel:</strong> “Oh. Does it? How many goblins have you met?” <strong>Well, I guess that&#8217;s kind of the beauty of roleplaying here! It&#8217;s kind of easy to have cover to play someone of a different gender. I just was curious how you think your voice fits the character, now that you&#8217;re in a different medium?</strong> <strong>Riegel: </strong>“You really hit the nail on the head. It’s fun to play these games and also to do animation because voice actors like me and Travis, we get to play characters that we would never get to play in live action television or in film. I&#8217;m playing a little goblin girl. Travis is playing a half-orc green guy with huge pecs. Now, he does have huge pecs in real life also, but that&#8217;s beside the point. “It really gives us a chance to explore different characterizations that we would never get to otherwise. The character of Nott is really special to me because she&#8217;s a ball of nerves and she is a bit crazed. But she also has some deep secrets and some reveals that come later in the series that really humanize her in some unexpected ways.” <strong>You mentioned Travis&#8217;s character, who has swole pecs. He’s a stranded sailor named Fjord. Throughout the early episodes, this character is called weak. But, Tasha, you gave him a lot of muscles. Are you playing on this dissonance for laughs?</strong> <strong>Willingham:</strong> “A little bit. I think it&#8217;s more of an origin from the livestream episodes years and years ago. There was a great undercurrent of Sam&#8217;s character, Nott the Brave, the little goblin girl, loving to poke at Fjord, being a half-orc and being a stronger-looking guy. But he seemed to classically fail at strength checks over and over and over. “Something about the character of Fjord is that he&#8217;s really trying to figure out who he is in this world after being separated from his crew and captain. I think we can say he&#8217;s probably overcompensating and trying to show off not just his muscles, but his ability to lead or make decisions or act like he knows what&#8217;s going on in the world. So I think Nott senses that and is using any opportunity to humble him”. <strong>Tasha Huo:</strong> “I think that gets to something too that makes the show so special, even though it is a goblin girl and it is a half-orc. We&#8217;re looking at characters that aren&#8217;t human at all. There is something very human about all of them. “Nott is dealing with a serious issue of alcoholism. A lot of her story is about where does that come from? And with Fjord, something that&#8217;s really fun to explore is insecurity, where it can come from, whether it&#8217;s real or not. You have people around him who don&#8217;t see that, and he sees it in himself. That’s always the biggest battle, right? It&#8217;s amazing that it&#8217;s a D&amp;D high fantasy show, but everything is just really very human and relatable.” <strong>Tasha, what is it like for someone who was a fan who saw this in your head, to bring it to life and now to actually see it live in the world?</strong> <strong>Huo</strong>: “It’s fan fiction, basically! They&#8217;re just letting me write fan fiction, thanks, Sam and Travis! Having fallen in love with all the characters and the story for so many years already and desperately trying to get all of my friends to watch the show, and then they look at the time code, and it says 4 hours per episode, and they run the other way. This is a chance to say this is why I was obsessed with this.” <strong>The way you just described that, it&#8217;s almost like an interpretation? You have this thing that you love and then you&#8217;re putting it through your lens and then sharing it with the people that you love.</strong> <strong>Huo</strong>: “It&#8217;s a totally different format, right? What these guys have done is create a live improv show because they are very talented voice actors. What we had to do in the show is tell a more contained, linear story. And if you&#8217;ve ever play a tabletop RPG, it’s absolutely bonkers. What you expect to happen in a given game never actually happens, and you go in crazy directions. With the show, we had to find some rails and find that common narrative that does exist in the show.” <strong>We&#8217;re living in a kind of a golden age for fantasy media for adults. “The Mighty Nein” is dark, it&#8217;s raunchy sometimes. It&#8217;s often super funny and catches you off guard. I&#8217;m curious what media inspired you as you went to work on this and to build this world?</strong> <strong>Riegel</strong>: “We&#8217;re sort of in the golden age of adult animation right now, too, with shows like ‘Arcane’ and ‘Blue Eye Samurai’ and ‘Invincible’ and our other show, ‘The Legend of Vox Machina.’ There&#8217;s a lot of interest and excitement around animated series that can transport you to other worlds and look at serious themes and also have nudity and poop jokes, but tell compelling stories. It&#8217;s just another way that everyone is discovering they can enjoy stories like these. It doesn&#8217;t always have to be $10 million episode budgets starring film actors who are between films. It can be smaller productions with voice actors as stars and homegrown stories like ours.” <strong>Huo</strong>: “I&#8217;m just so proud of this show, guys. To come at it as a fan nerd girl and to then produce something that is just such a great story. It&#8217;s so compelling. People who have never even heard of D&amp;D will watch it and love it. And that is my greatest joy.” ____ <em><a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/james-perkins\">James Perkins-Mastromarino</a> and produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/todd-mundt\">Todd Mundt</a>.

    "title": "As a labor force, artists are 'invisible.' A new survey tries to change that",
    "text": "We all know the trope of the starving artist,\" said researcher Gwendolyn Rugg, \"But there's actually surprisingly little reliable data out there to back this up.\" Rugg, a senior research scientist for NORC at The University of Chicago, a nonpartisan research organization, is the lead author of a <a href=\"https://www.mellon.org/article/window-into-us-artists-their-livelihoods\" target=\"_blank\"><u>new report</u></a> on artists' lives and their livelihoods. Researchers surveyed more than 2,600 artists nationwide from across disciplines and working arrangements. They were asked a range of questions on everything from housing, the hours they work and health benefits to how they make money. The study was funded by the Mellon Foundation. Among the key findings: <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li>57% of artists reported being \"somewhat or very worried\" about being able to afford \"food, housing, medical care, or utilities\";<br></li><li>37% received income from public assistance sources, including Social Security and state or local welfare;<br></li><li>34% of artists are self-employed, 11% \"juggled three or more jobs\";<br></li><li>28% \"provide unpaid assistance to a family member or friend due to a health condition or disability.\"<br></li></ul> The NORC study released Wednesday isn't the first to confirm that most artists aren't in it for the money and that the systems that support them in the United States are fragile. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5604385/museums-attendance-donations-grants-trump\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Museums</u></a> are struggling this year. Government and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5526923/twenty-new-dance-projects-will-receive-up-to-100k-each-but-the-grant-program-is-ending\" target=\"_blank\"><u>foundation</u></a> grants can be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/26/nx-s1-5518202/nea-cancels-creative-writing-fellowship\" target=\"_blank\"><u>precarious</u></a>. During the pandemic, concert venues and theaters were <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/09/873196748/americas-independent-music-venues-could-close-soon-due-to-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\"><u>among</u></a> the first to close and the last to reopen. But Rugg said this is the first study to \"paint a more comprehensive and nuanced portrait of working artists today.\" \"And not having that data,\" said Gonzalo Casals, \"you're invisible.\" Casals commissioned the survey when he was a senior policy fellow for arts and culture at the Mellon Foundation. Today, he is co-director of the Culture and Arts Policy Institute, which provides policy guidance for those in New York's arts sector. The dire picture painted by studies of the arts ecosystem is in contrast to reports on the positive economic <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov/news/press-releases/2025/arts-and-cultural-industries-grew-twice-rate-us-economy-adding-12-trillion\" target=\"_blank\"><u>impact</u></a> of the arts and the social and emotional <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov/stories/blog/2025/educating-ourselves-about-childhood-arts-experiences-and-why-they-matter\" target=\"_blank\"><u>benefits</u></a> of arts education. Kerri-Noelle Humphrey, executive director of the Alabama Dance Council, says she uses every study she can get her hands on to raise money and awareness about both the art form of dance and the people who make it. Humphrey said there are plenty of people who love attending dance performances but \"don't understand the process. They just see the outcome.\" \"Most dancers who work in a company don't have health insurance benefits. And when you work in a career that is athletic, you would think having the ability to go to a doctor for regular care would be something that would be a part of your full time job. And it is not necessarily that way,\" said Humphrey, \"So the data helps us quantify those stories that we see every day.\" Rugg believes \"the best programs and policies are always rooted in data\" but that many arts organizations have had a \"data allergy stemming from some combination of a lack of desire or a lack of resources.<strong>\"</strong> Anyone can access the results of the study <a href=\"https://www.mellon.org/article/window-into-us-artists-their-livelihoods\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>. NORC has also posted the \"<a href=\"https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/39447\" target=\"_blank\"><u>survey instrument</u></a>\" so that other organizations can replicate it for their purposes. \"We spent well over a year constructing this survey instrument that we feel is quite methodologically sound,\" said Rugg, \"We…compiled the best questions from various data sources, and then created novel questions where we saw gaps. By publicly releasing this instrument, the hope is that other folks in the field can utilize it in any way that they want going forward.\"<br> <em>This story was edited by Jennifer Vanasco.</em>",

    "title": "New poetry stresses that our stories are more precious and urgent than ever",
    "text": "<em>Editor's Note: This review discusses suicide.</em> How can poetry help us now, when practically every morning brings a fresh assault on knowledge, wisdom and safety? Amid the cruel political discourse horrifying headlines that seem to envelop everything, where is there a place for poetry? What can a bunch of artfully arranged words do? A lot, I'd argue. Words are among the many things under attack. Our stories, the ways that we fill our words with our own meanings, are more precious and urgent than ever, as three new books this fall by poets in – or entering – mid-career make clear. They lay claim to stories of identity, suffering and hope, to a kind of collective subjectivity, to the inner life of a country in the throes of deep pain and uncertainty. Here's a look: <h3><strong><em>Blue Opening</em> by Chet'la Sebree</strong></h3> Chet'la Sebree's third book begins with the thwarted wish to have a child: \"Many in my family have been plagued/ by menorrhagia in early middle age--/ fibrinous weeds causing their bodies to bleed streams,/ flooding lands no longer suitable for plants.\" What follows is a rapidly paced, heart-stricken coming to terms with a body and a future suddenly altered by autoimmune disease, with the meanings of motherhood and daughterhood, and with the stunned language required to describe it all when there is \"no one to know/ my body's vernacular, that it would mistake me for foreigner.\" Blindingly clear and unornamented, these poems have all their cards on the table, \"pregnant with grief—/ it's bloated, black, a matted thatch.\" If the body is in revolt — \"I am not the owner of this vessel I thought I owned, implies the man trying to sell it to me\" — then it is through language that Sebree can lay claim to herself, to her story, and take it back. The lexicons of motherhood and illness (\"I accept this list of words:// necrotizing lymphadenitis and swell-scrambled nerves\") become a vocabulary of grief and profound disappointment with what may and may not be possible. Sebree searches for language to carry the grief and to promise some kind of hope and inner rebirth; she finds a surprising kind of peace and power \"when a centrifuge spins/ my blood 3,000 revolutions per minute/ to render me perhaps anew to me again.\" A new kind of creation becomes possible, as well, through poetry. <h3><strong><em>The Seeds</em> by Cecily Parks</strong></h3> With <em>The Seeds</em>, her third book, Cecily Parks comes into her full powers. These poems are dark, lavish, far-reaching and subtly layered, making a harsh and rich mirror of the pastoral and the domestic. Parks reckons with the compromises that every life demands, that motherhood and art demand, that a country where violence and cruelty are suddenly triumphant require: \"now I think of hope// as a swing chained to a branch./ it can be used until/ the branch sweeps the ground/ with a shush shush because/ it cannot bear/ so much weight and still loft through/ the dream-trafficked air.\" Parks' powers of description are breathtaking, not only because one feels transported but also because, as in the poems of Elizabeth Bishop, the emotion, the domestic or personal story, is interwoven into – always an undercurrent of, a reason for – the description. But somehow, the world as described also feels like the world, not a projection. In these poems, Parks feels with her eyes. The writing is simply beautiful: \"the grackles plummet down to pierce the lawn/ for seeds and fat brown live oak acorns.\" The words dart in and out of the rhythm like the grackles' dark beaks, making gentle animals of a mother and her \"ravenous daughters.\" This book is a delight, a feast of grief and determined celebration. A fallen world this lovingly observed must be at least somewhat redeemed. <h3><strong><em>The New Economy</em> by Gabrielle Calvocoressi</strong></h3> Hopelessness is a beloved enemy in these poems, a necessary muse. So are grief and fear. \"The days I don't want to kill myself/ are extraordinary,\" begins the most affirming poem about suicide I've ever read. But these are not merely affirming poems (though one of them is titled \"Affirmation Cistern When I Let Go of My Fear Life Becomes Magical\"). Calvocoressi is at home in the dark, they live there, even if light is their element. They're wise because they're wary: \"every being will slaughter/ their neighbor if they're hungry,/ and enough.\" All of our violence, they assert – with a compassion so pure it feels out of step with the times – is born of fear: \"when I was little I wanted/ to be tough to beat people up to own a gun./ wanted the boy body that would keep my body/ from being so scared.\" Violence begins in each of us, is always inflicted first upon ourselves. And yet, we persist, try to do better – we must. A series of \"Miss You\" poems, high-energy elegies for loved ones who have died, celebrate life emphatically by not quite letting go of the past: \"miss you in your puffy blue jacket./ They're hip now. I can bring you a new one/ if only you'll come by. Know I told you /it was okay to go. Know I told you it was okay/ to leave me./ Why'd you believe me?\" Why let the past go? Where else do we live but our stories? Where else can we rest from the terrors of the present? Where else can we remind ourselves of the beauty of the world? <em>If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, call or text 9 8 8 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.</em>",

    "title": "World Toilet Day is today! Um ... is that really the best name?",
    "text": "Happy World Toilet Day! No, that's not a joke. Nov. 19 is <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/observances/toilet-day\" target=\"_blank\">World Toilet Day</a> — declared by the United Nations in 2001. The goal is to call attention to the 3.4 billion people who live without \"safely managed sanitation\" and the more than 300 million people who engage in \"open defecation\" — doing their business in the great outdoors. Now, it sure would be great if everyone on Earth had a toilet. However, unless that toilet is connected to an effective and sanitary sewage disposal system, it would merely be a porcelain throne. \"What the world needs is not toilets,\" says <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/stephen-luby\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Stephen Luby</a>, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment. \"Low-income communities need effective sewers and sanitation that separate their water and food from the human fecal stream.\" Right now, that's not the case in many places. On a visit to a community in Nairobi, Kenya, I saw diapers floating amid the trash in a water-filled gutter on a bustling dirt road. And there were piles of \"flying toilets,\" too. That's what it's called when people have to poop, use a plastic bag and fling it outside. It's not a new thing, by the way. People used to poop in buckets and throw it out the window in Europe in the 1800s. The disposal of human excrement is not a new issue. \"Poop has always been with us,\" says Luby. \"We're mammals, this is what we do.\" It used to be simple for hunter-gatherers to designate a place to poop far from places where communities live and prepare food and eat, he says. But with over 7 billion people on Earth, we now need \"remarkable engineering\" to handle sewage. \" Like many things in our public health system, \"it's hidden from us, so costs are kind of hidden from us,\" Luby says. And those systems can soak up resources: \"In the U.S. we expend 15,000 liters of water per person per year to move our poop to the sewage treatment plant,\" he says. Setting up a sanitation system would require a huge investment in infrastructure, especially in poor communities where funds are limited. \"I don't think there's any panacea,\" Luby says, calling for research into solutions — a composting toilet, a \"dry sanitation solution,\" turning fecal matter into compost, which could be done in homes with a little sawdust and a container designed so the smell is vented out. \"It'll break down pretty quickly,\" he says. The World Toilet Day organizers agree that toilets aren't enough. The theme of the 2025 event is \"sanitation in a changing world.\" The surge in rainfall because of climate change has overwhelmed many sewerage systems — including in big cities like New York, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ann-thomas-298b665/\" target=\"_blank\">Ann Thomas</a>, sanitation team lead at UNICEF. \"Because we have combined sewer systems, rainwater and household domestic waste combines and overloads the treatment plants\" — and raw sewage ends up being dumped into local rivers. Addressing such issues will require a financial commitment, she points out. She's also advocating for alternative \"sewerage.\" In India, there's the twin pit solution, she says: two pits side by side that are used in an alternating fashion. Once the first pit is filled with fecal matter, the household simply switches a valve to begin using the second pit. After about a year, time, temperature and other factors will kill off the pathogens in the first pit so the human waste can be removed safely and used as compost. Thomas does like the name \"World Toilet Day\" — it was coined to call attention to a taboo topic, and the word toilet is \"funny,\" she says.  And coming up with a new name is a challenge. World Sanitation Day doesn't quite have the same ring. Luby did have an idea: \"World poop day — I'd endorse that.\" Thomas laughs at the thought and says, \"I don't know — it could be something we put on the menu for next year!\" Although she's not sure it's time to retire the name World Toilet Day: \"It walks the line between not being offensive and being fun.",

    "title": "A Frida Kahlo painting broke records at auction on Thursday",
    "text": "An arresting self-portrait by Frida Kahlo, featuring the artist slumbering beneath a tangle of vines in a carved canopy bed with a skeleton reclining above her, set records at a Sotheby's auction on Thursday night in New York. The 1940 painting, called <em>El sueño (La cama)</em>,<strong> </strong>sold for $54.7 million, the most expensive artwork by a woman ever auctioned.  It also broke the previous auction record for Kahlo's work. \"<em>El sueño</em> stands among Frida Kahlo's greatest masterworks — a rare and striking example of her most surrealist impulses,\" said Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby's head of Latin American art, in a statement. \"Kahlo fuses dream imagery and symbolic precision with unmatched emotional intensity, creating a work that is at once deeply personal and universally resonant.\" The sale of <em>El Sueño (La cama)</em> outstripped the 2014 record set by Kahlo's friend and contemporary Georgia O'Keeffe, when O'Keeffe's 1932 work <em>Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1</em> sold at auction for $44.4 million. The last time Frida Kahlo broke an auction record was in 2021, when her 1949 work <em>Diego y yo </em>sold for $34.9 million; then the highest price for a Latin American artwork. Still, the final sale price is shy of the  $60 million Sotheby's had estimated for the high end of the sale. Bidding slowed dramatically at around $40 million and for a few tense seconds, it seemed uncertain whether the painting would break the record for women artists. Di Stasi handled the winning bid for a buyer on the phone whose identity is not yet known.  At a moment when art sales have dramatically softened,<a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/museums-politics-2679093\" target=\"_blank\"> museums face massive financial restructuring</a> and a number of leading galleries have shuttered, the buzz around this painting is significant but not surprising. Surrealist women artists are currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/feb/11/women-surrealists-gender-occult-cats\" target=\"_blank\">in vogue among collectors</a>, and Kahlo is among a small handful of superstar artists with a seemingly bulletproof brand — think Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Gustav Klimt. A Klimt painting auctioned by Sotheby's on Tuesday sold for $236.4 million, making it the second-most expensive painting ever auctioned. Kahlo's mystique erupts in part from her psychologically complex self-portraits that focus on her disabilities, her politics, her heritage and her deep connection to the world shimmering around her. \"Her paintings tell stories — intimate, engaging, terrifying and tragic ones,\" wrote art historian Sharyn R. Udall in her 2003 article, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1358781\" target=\"_blank\">\"Frida Kahlo's Mexican Body: History, Identity and Artistic Aspiration,\"</a> published in <em>Woman's Art Journal.</em> \"When Kahlo looked into death's dark mirror, she saw herself. In the act of painting and in the resulting canvases, she documented her own attempts to survive pain, to make sense of it, to act out through images layered with irony, fantasy and allegory. Her work is searingly candid, overlaid with the unreality of an endless nightmare.\" And her work seems to only grow in power. Just within the past year, more than a dozen museums around the world exhibited shows dedicated to Kahlo. An <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/see-inside-the-powerful-new-immersive-frida-kahlo-show-in-brooklyn-that-attempts-to-depict-what-the-artist-could-not-2202929\" target=\"_blank\">immersive experience</a> that brought audiences inside some of them has been traveling internationally. The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston will soon open a vast retrospective called <em>Frida: The Making of an Icon. </em>It's scheduled to transfer to the Tate Modern in London next June. And a new Frida Kahlo museum that explores the artist's early life opened in Kahlo's neighborhood in Mexico City in September. It's the third museum that centers Kahlo's life and art in the city.",

The meeting between the two leaders resulted in a number of deals, including the U.S. agreeing to sell the Saudis tanks and F-35 fighter jets. The White House also announced that Saudi Arabia is <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5613256:x\" target=\"_blank\">pledging to invest $1 trillion</a> in the U.S. The text for many additional agreements that the two countries say they have signed has not yet been released.</li></ul> <strong>Both the House and the Senate have moved to compel the Justice Department to publicly release files</strong> related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The legislation applies to unclassified documents, communications, or investigative materials held by the Justice Department, the FBI, and U.S. attorneys' offices involved in the cases.

There are signs that Democrats could reap the benefits of these critiques heading into the 2026 midterm elections.

The poll also revealed that people are <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5613256:x\" target=\"_blank\">generally dissatisfied with everything</a>; respondents expressed little to no confidence in Congress, the media, political parties, the Supreme Court or the presidency.</li></ul> <h3>Deep dive</h3> Trump floated the idea of a 50-year fixed mortgage, a concept that many observers, including some Trump supporters, hate.

    "title": "Student escapes as authorities search for 24 other girls abducted in Nigeria",
    "text": "MAGA, Nigeria — A schoolgirl who was abducted with 24 others from a dormitory in northwestern Nigeria has escaped and is safe, the school's principal told The Associated Press on Tuesday, as hunters joined security forces in the search for the missing students in forests close to the school. The girls were kidnapped before dawn on Monday, when gunmen attacked the dorm at the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Kebbi state's Maga town. Local police said the gunmen scaled the fence to enter the school premises and exchanged gunfire with police officers before seizing the girls and killing a staff member. No group has claimed responsibility for taking the girls, but analysts and locals say gangs of bandits often target schools, travelers and remote villagers in kidnappings for ransoms. Authorities say the bandits are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes between them over strained resources. Mass school kidnappings are especially common in northern Nigeria, and the Kebbi school is close to conflict hot spots including Zamfara and Sokoto states, where several gangs are known to operate and hide out. The student who escaped arrived home late Monday, hours after the kidnapping, according to the school principal Musa Rabi Magaji. Another student was able to escape the gunmen in the minutes after the raid and was not abducted, the principal told AP. \"They are safe and sound,\" Magaji said. A video verified by AP shows the two schoolgirls, who appear to be in their early teens, lost in thought and surrounded by family and other villagers, with hijabs covering their heads. High schoolers in Nigeria are usually aged between 12 and 17. <h3>Intensified rescue efforts</h3> Security forces and hunters, meanwhile, have intensified efforts to find and rescue the others, local officials said. Security teams swept nearby forests where gangs often hide while others were deployed along major roads leading to the school. Kebbi Gov. Nasir Idris visited the school on Monday and assured of efforts to rescue the girls, and Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Waidi Shaibu met with soldiers in the hours after the attack and directed \"intelligence-driven operations and relentless day-and-night pursuit of the abductors,\" according to an army statement. \"We must find these children. Act decisively and professionally on all intelligence. Success is not optional,\" the army chief said. <h3>Families recount predawn attack</h3> By Tuesday morning, the dorm and the classroom block — a walking distance apart — were deserted. In Maga, families waiting for news of their children's freedom expressed anger and frustration. Resident Abdulkarim Abdullahi, whose daughter and granddaughter — aged 13 and 10, respectively — were among the kidnapped children, said he overheard the noise from his house. \"I was at home when I suddenly heard gunshots from the school. We were told that the attackers entered the school with many motorcycles,\" said Abdullahi. Amina Hassan, wife of the school vice principal Hassan Yakubu Makuku, said the assailants broke into their house, which is on the school premises, and fatally shot her husband. He was also the school's chief security officer. \"Three of them entered and asked my husband, 'Are you Malam Hassan?' and he responded, 'Yes, I am.' They told him that we are here to kill you,\" she told the AP. <h3>School abductions are a strategy to draw attention</h3> At least 1,500 students have been seized in the region since Boko Haram jihadi extremists seized 276 Chibok schoolgirls over a decade ago. But bandits are also active in the region, and analysts say gangs often target schools to gain attention. Analysts and residents blame the insecurity on a failure to prosecute known attackers, and the rampant corruption that limits weapons supplies to security forces while ensuring a steady supply to the gangs. \"Let's say people have been kidnapped in the markets — it doesn't go far, (or) if people have been kidnapped on the road — it doesn't go far,\" said Oluwole Ojewale, a security analyst at the Institute for Security Studies. \"What gains traction is when (it is) strategic kidnapping, like school children.",

    "text": "<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/12/nx-s1-5415890/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-review\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Mario Kart World</u></a> blasted through the finish line this summer. Sonic Racing: Crossworlds <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog/sonic-racing-crossworlds-has-sold-1-million-copies-in-under-a-month-while-the-overwhelmingly-positive-steam-rating-holds-strong/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>rushed up the sales charts</u></a> this fall. Now, after more than two decades, a sequel to a GameCube classic is launching in time for the holidays. It's been a banner year for such cartoony racing games, but Kirby Air Riders may take the crown with its deep customization and radically simple controls. The game stays true to the original Air Ride's minimalism. You accelerate constantly and steer with the left joystick. Hold nearly any other button to brake, which lets you drift through corners and charge up a boost gauge. Release the button once you're charged to sprint ahead. Tap a button instead to inhale a nearby enemy. If that enemy has a \"copy ability,\" you'll absorb it to sling fireballs, spray ice crystals, shoot out spikes — the list goes on. You can also damage opponents by waggling your joystick to spin into them. Each hit gives you a speed boost. That's pretty much it! The game extracts a dizzying variety of playstyles out of these basics. Every racer has different stats and special moves. Machines have unique quirks on top of their own stats. One slides around when you brake. Another zips forward, only changing direction when you charge up. Yet another hops off the ground when you wiggle the joystick to spin. These varied playstyles serve different purposes throughout the game's many multiplayer modes. The standard one, Air Ride, comes packed with new and returning courses. The contrasting Top Ride mode cranes the camera up from behind your racer to a bird's-eye view of the entire track. While this mode is much improved from the 2003 version of Top Ride, it's still finicky and frustrating. Finally, there's City Trial, the game's best and most inventive mode. In matches that rarely exceed 10 minutes, you'll cruise around a huge map, snarfing up upgrades and swapping between vehicles before a final showdown that shuffles between races, gladiatorial arenas, high jumps, and more. City Trial can even accommodate up to 16 online players for maximum chaos, and I'm sure it'll once again dominate my family's gaming time! All these modes get remixed in Air Riders' all-new single-player campaign. This roguelike-esque \"Road Trip\" extrapolates the stat-hunting of City Trial into bite-sized challenges. You'll zoom through diverse stages, encountering your choice of obstacles to overcome for stat upgrades, which you'll need to beat periodic bosses and unravel a bonkers story. A full Road Trip can take nearly two hours to complete, stringing together dozens of micro-contests that last from several seconds (no joke) to just over a minute. I grew tired of the format by my third time through, but vehicle unlocks and the odd achievement still spattered my brain with the dopamine I craved. Road Trip mode is ultimately a sideshow. This really is a multiplayer game, boasting the deepest online features of any Nintendo game I've seen. I joined a session for reviewers and hung out in a \"paddock\" between matches — a lobby where I could cycle through emotes and watch the result screens of other party members' games. It's also where we flaunted our fits. You earn \"Miles\" as you play, a currency you'll spend to costume your racers and bedeck your machines in an eye-melting array of decals, wraps and add-ons. It's unsurprising that designer Masahiro Sakurai, who created Super Smash Bros. as well as Kirby, would lavish attention on multiplayer bombast. But these flourishes contrast with the game's mechanical restraint. Air Riders could have overcomplicated the formula in a thousand different ways. Instead, the game's elegant core feels as fresh in 2025 as it did in 2003.",

    "title": "Flu season could be nasty this winter",
    "text": "The U.S. may be entering another rough winter for flu, according to early data. \"The signs are, it could be a big season,\" says <a href=\"https://www.stjude.org/research/labs/webby-lab/webby-lab-team.html\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Webby</a>, who studies the flu at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. \"The flu season might have a little bit of a punch to it this year.\" The first clue to what may be in store is what influenza did during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. That often predicts what's coming for the Northern Hemisphere. \"They had some pretty decent flu activity in many parts of the Southern Hemisphere,\" Webby says. \"It actually lasted for a longer period of time — the tail of the season went on for longer than typical.\" And now, parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the United Kingdom, are being hit hard. That often foreshadows what's in store for the U.S. Another clue is the Northern Hemisphere's dominant flu strain so far. It's an H3N2 flu virus, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> flu tracker. And H3N2 viruses \"tend to be a little bit more problematic,\" Webby says. \"When we have an H3N2 season, we tend to have a little bit more activity, a little bit more disease at the severe end of the spectrum.\" The last major flu season dominated by H3N2 was 2016-2017. In addition, a new H3N2 variant recently evolved and has become the dominant strain in the U.S. \"There is basically a new variant of influenza circulating that has mutated a little bit,\" says <a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3525/caitlin-m-rivers\" target=\"_blank\">Caitlin Rivers</a>, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. \"And that means that it's just different enough from what your body or the vaccine may recognize that it can kind of get around those protections.\" And she says the flu shot this year \"may not be as good a match as if we hadn't seen this new variant.\" That said, data from the U.K. indicates the vaccines still make a difference, Rivers says. In the U.K., the vaccines appear to be about 70% to 75% protective against hospitalization in children and about 30% to 40% protective against hospitalization in adults. So Rivers and others are urging anyone who hasn't already gotten a flu shot to get one. \"Definitely get it as soon as possible. Because activity is low right now. But it is increasing. And it will continue to increase straight through until we hit peak, which is usually around the holiday season. There's no sense in waiting when we are barreling into flu season,\" Rivers says. It takes about two weeks for immunity to kick in. And people don't want to catch or spread the flu over Thanksgiving. The flu kills between roughly 12,000 and 52,000 people in the U.S. every winter. \"I do have concerns that uptake of both the influenza and the annual COVID vaccine won't be as high this year as it had been in previous years,\" Rivers said. She is concerned by rhetoric coming from federal health officials questioning \"whether vaccines are safe and effective.\" \"We know that they are,\" she says. \"And they are important for protecting against severe illness. So it's really important that people go out and get them this year.\" In a written statement to NPR, a Health and Human Services spokesperson said: \"It is too early to know what viruses will spread this season, in what proportion, and how well the vaccine will work in the United States.\" The statement added: \"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Individuals should speak to their healthcare provider on the risks and benefits of a vaccine.\"<br>",

    "title": "3 massive changes you'll see as the climate careens toward tipping points",
    "text": "World leaders are heading into the final days of COP30, the United Nations climate meeting in Brazil. They are trying to agree on how to curb global warming and pay for the costs of an increasingly hotter planet. For the past <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/08/655360909/grim-forecast-from-u-n-on-global-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">eight years</a>, one of the primary objectives of the annual negotiations has been to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to the temperatures in the late 1800s. That temperature goal was established after a landmark international scientific report laid out the catastrophic effects of exceeding that amount of warming. But that goal is no longer plausible, scientists say. Humanity has not cut planet-warming pollution quickly enough, and the planet will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, likely in the next decade, according to a <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/48854;jsessionid=ACE1B56D68DB246540380BAF371300D3\" target=\"_blank\">recent United Nations report</a>. However, all is not lost. If countries can cut overall greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035, scientists say the planet would quickly return to lower levels of warming. \"We must move much, much faster on both reductions of emissions and strengthening resilience,\" U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell told world leaders at COP30. Right now, countries are pursuing policies that would cut emissions by just 12% by 2035. \"The science is clear: We can and must bring temperatures back down to 1.5 [degrees Celsius] after any temporary overshoot,\" Stiell said. If countries follow through on current promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the latest estimates suggest that Earth's temperature will <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5593050/climate-emissions-gap-cop30\" target=\"_blank\">top out</a> around 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming this century. The latest science also makes clear the profound human costs of exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, even temporarily. The planet has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius, according to the <a href=\"https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2024-warmest-year-record-about-155degc-above-pre-industrial-level\" target=\"_blank\">World Meteorological Organization</a>. And communities are already experiencing more dangerous storms, flooding and heat waves. When the<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/08/1052198840/1-5-degrees-warming-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\"> planet heats up beyond 1.5 degrees</a>, the impacts don't get just slightly worse. Scientists warn that massive, self-reinforcing changes could be set off, having devastating impacts around the world. Such changes are sometimes called climate tipping points, although they're not as abrupt as that term would suggest. Most will unfold over the course of decades. Some could take centuries. Some may be partially reversible. But they all have enormous and lasting implications for humans, plants and animals on Earth. And every tenth of a degree of warming makes these tipping points more likely, according to a <a href=\"https://global-tipping-points.org/\" target=\"_blank\">new report</a> from 160 international climate researchers. Here are the three most important and well-studied changes, from collapsing ice sheets to thawing Arctic permafrost, to disappearing coral reefs. <strong>Change No. 1: Coral reefs could be gone forever</strong> For coral reefs, the tipping point may have already begun. Widespread coral die-offs have been seen around the globe as ocean temperatures heat up, making it the first domino to fall, according to a <a href=\"https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-stories/2025-10-13-world-reaches-first-climate-tipping-point---widespread-mortality-of-coral-reefs.html\" target=\"_blank\">new report</a>. By overall area, coral reefs are a tiny part of the ocean. But they're a bedrock ecosystem for marine life, supporting an estimated 25% of all species. Corals are highly sensitive to heat. When marine heat waves hit, corals come under stress, and they expel the algae that live inside them and that they need to survive. The reefs then turn a ghostly white color. A bleaching event doesn't necessarily mean the end for a coral reef. Corals have the ability to recover, given enough time. But repeated heat waves, as seen at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/03/26/1088886918/australia-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-climate\" target=\"_blank\">Australia's Great Barrier Reef </a>and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5547122/florida-coral-reef-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">off the coast of Florida</a>, can kill a reef, leading to the collapse of the ecosystem. Oceans are also becoming more acidic as they absorb the carbon dioxide emitted by humans from burning fossil fuels. That also stresses corals, making it difficult for them to build their skeletons. High ocean temperatures caused a <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-confirms-4th-global-coral-bleaching-event\" target=\"_blank\">global coral bleaching event</a> in 2023-24, the second in the last 10 years. If the world passes 2 degrees Celsius of heating, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/08/1052198840/1-5-degrees-warming-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">99% of the world's coral reefs could be lost</a>. The damage is happening faster than scientists expected. Combined with the effects of pollution and human development, half of all reefs worldwide will be in unlivable conditions by 2035, according to a <a href=\"https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2022/10/11/coral-reefs-climate-change-threat/\" target=\"_blank\">recent study</a> from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. \"The coming decades will bring, I think, unprecedented change for both these reef systems and humanity in general,\" says Erik Franklin, professor at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, who worked on the study. It's estimated that half a billion people around the world depend on coral reefs for food, income and livelihoods. Losing reefs would destabilize many countries, along with risking extinction for marine life that can only be found on coral reefs. \"There's entire societies and economies that are built around reef systems, especially in equatorial and tropical regions,\" Franklin says. \"So these societies will be in dire straits.\" Many scientists are searching for \"refuges\" — pockets of the ocean where conditions might remain livable for coral reefs. They're also selectively breeding corals, both in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5547122/florida-coral-reef-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">Florida</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/01/1241431817/coral-climate-change-heat-great-barrier-reef-bleaching\" target=\"_blank\">Australia</a>, boosting the corals' natural abilities to withstand heat. The hope is that it might help corals hold on,<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/17/1245085914/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change-algae\" target=\"_blank\"> surviving just long enough</a> until humans can get their heat-trapping emissions under control. <strong>Change No. 2: Ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica could collapse</strong> Ice sheets are the massive frozen expanses that cover Greenland and Antarctica and <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/learn/parts-cryosphere/ice-sheets/ice-sheet-quick-facts\" target=\"_blank\">contain about two-thirds</a> of the freshwater on Earth. Climate change is already causing them to melt and raising sea levels around the world. But if the Earth lingers at, or above, 2 degrees Celsius of warming, as it is on track to, that melting will steadily accelerate. Scientists warn that will cause parts of the ice sheets to collapse, sending massive amounts of water into the world's oceans. The million-dollar question is how quickly that collapse will occur. \"Collapse tends to be a bit of a loaded word. People think of it like a building collapse,\" says Ian Joughin, a glaciologist at the University of Washington who has spent decades studying how giant glaciers move and change. \"Maybe a better timescale for an ice sheet [collapsing] is the Roman Empire,\" Joughin explains. Like a dying empire, the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica are huge. It will take decades or even centuries for them to disintegrate. This year marks the <a href=\"https://eng.geus.dk/about/news/news-archive/2025/september/greenland-ice-sheet-massbalance-2025\" target=\"_blank\">29th year</a> in a row that Greenland has lost more ice than it gained. In 2021, <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/ice-sheets-today/analyses/rain-summit-greenland\" target=\"_blank\">rainfall was recorded</a> at the ice sheet's highest point, rather than snow, a sign that warmer temperatures were triggering widespread melting. As temperatures continue to warm, scientists say the 2-mile-thick ice sheet in Greenland is getting out of balance. Snow and ice are melting faster than they're being replaced, and as the ice melt accelerates, the process is difficult to stop. Research suggests that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet may already be underway. A massive glacier there, which covers an area about the size of the state of Washington, is melting quickly in response to climate change and could splinter into the ocean in the coming decades. If that glacier melts entirely, it will add so much water to the oceans that sea levels will rise about 2 feet. If the entire West Antarctic ice sheet melts, scientists estimate that sea levels will rise about 12 feet. Due to their enormous size, ice sheets have a huge amount of inertia. Once the melt process gets underway, it's difficult to stop. \"It takes a few hundred years to really get going,\" says Joughin. \"And it's kind of a snowball effect, where the faster it goes, the more it's going to go.\" But it will take a long time for people around the world to feel the most extreme effects of that melt. \"It could be anywhere from two or three hundred years to a thousand years,\" says Joughin. If humans slow down the pace of global warming, it will help slow down the pace of ice melting, giving the billions of people who live along coastlines more time to adapt. <strong>Change No. 3: Permanently frozen ground is thawing</strong> Climate change is causing permafrost — the permanently frozen ground in the Arctic — to thaw. And as the Earth approaches 2 degrees Celsius of warming, that thawing ground will cause both local and global problems. Let's start local. When permafrost thaws, the ice that's trapped in the ground turns into water and drains away. \"It can have really profound consequences,\" says Merritt Turetsky, a permafrost researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"We can see lakes draining overnight. We can see ecosystems becoming much drier in some areas, because the permafrost was actually holding the water up at the surface.\" That's because when the ground is frozen, it's impermeable to moisture, like the lining of a bathtub. \"When it thaws, we pull the drain out of the bathtub,\" Turetsky explains. Thawing permafrost has profound impacts for the millions of people who live in the Arctic. In many places, the land is sinking as it thaws, cracking the foundations of buildings, buckling roads and runways and kinking pipelines. That will accelerate as the Earth heats up more. Thawing permafrost also has global climate implications. Permanently frozen ground is like the world's freezer: millennia of dead plants and animals are locked up in permafrost. \"When permafrost thaws it's a little like losing power to your freezer. That food starts to rot,\" explains Ted Schuur, a permafrost expert at Northern Arizona University. Bacteria and fungi start to digest the carbon-rich soil, releasing planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Basically, it's an infinite loop of greenhouse gases: human emissions cause the planet to heat up. That heat thaws permafrost, which releases more emissions. In recent years, advances in Arctic data collection have allowed scientists to measure greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost more accurately, says Schuur. The upshot has been sobering. \"This new science is showing that this is happening right now,\" he explains. The so-called tipping point has <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/2024-arctic-report-card-arctic-tundra-now-net-source-carbon-dioxide\" target=\"_blank\">already begun</a>. But how much extra carbon ultimately gets released by Arctic permafrost in the future is up to humans. \"The faster we can decarbonize society today, the more permafrost carbon we can keep in the Arctic ground where it belongs,\" says Turetsky. For example, by using renewable energy sources instead of burning fossil fuels. \"Every tenth of a degree matters. And every act we take matters,\" says Schuur. <em>A version of this story was originally published in 2021.</em>",

    "text": "Thanksgiving is always the fourth Thursday of November. But many Americans don't wait that long to share a fall feast with their loved ones — that is, if they celebrate Friendsgiving. Friendsgiving is exactly what it sounds like: A gathering close to the date of Thanksgiving, starring many of its starchy staples, usually served potluck-style, with friends instead of relatives. Think fewer dinner-table political debates, less travel time, turkey optional (more on that later). \"There are your friends, and there's Thanksgiving,\" says Emily Brewster, a senior editor at Merriam-Webster. \"It's a great example of a word that is just an excellent candidate for adoption as soon as someone thought of it.\" This installment of NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-57824/word-of-the-week\" target=\"_blank\">Word of the Week</a> series takes a look at where Friendsgiving comes from, why it stuck around and how to celebrate it. <h3>A new name for an old tradition </h3> Of course, people have been celebrating Thanksgiving with friends for centuries. The concept of Friendsgiving has long permeated pop culture, from 1973's <em>A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving</em> (in which an overburdened Snoopy cooks for the gang after they invite themselves over) to <em>Friends</em>, which went on the air in 1994 and included <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/why-celebrate-friendsgiving-yes-related-160500921.html\" target=\"_blank\">Thanksgiving plotlines</a> in each of its 10 seasons. But the proper noun only came along relatively recently. <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/friendsgiving-meaning\" target=\"_blank\">Merriam-Webster</a> started tracking \"Friendsgiving\" in 2007, after it appeared in posts on what was then Twitter and the early message board Usenet. The word's obvious meaning and accessible pronunciation helped it catch on quickly, Brewster says. \"Friendsgiving\" popped up in lifestyle blogs and news articles over the years before hitting it big in 2011. That year, it was both the focus of a Bailey's Irish Cream <a href=\"https://amandaformaro.com/friendsgiving-with-baileys-irish-cream/#:~:text=A%20couple%20months%20ago%20I,drinks%20and%20a%20few%20laughs.\" target=\"_blank\">ad campaign</a> and a major plot point in a <em>Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> episode (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1944951/\" target=\"_blank\">titled \"Gobblefellas\"</a>). Google <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=friendsgiving\" target=\"_blank\">searches for \"Friendsgiving\"</a> spiked that November, and increased every year for the rest of the decade. \"All a word like this really needs is to just have more of a presence in the culture, and then it gets adopted into the language very quickly,\" Brewster says. Merriam-Webster added \"Friendsgiving\" <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Friendsgiving\" target=\"_blank\">to its dictionary</a> in 2020, 13 years after its first known use. While Brewster wasn't involved in that decision, she says \"it was clear that it met our criteria.\" \"We had been seeing these examples of it for a few years, and … it looked like it wasn't going to go anywhere,\" Brewster adds. The made-up holiday has inspired <a href=\"https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/marketing/chains-jump-friendsgiving-marketing-opportunities\" target=\"_blank\">chain restaurant deals</a> and numerous hosting guides, and even counted a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/11/21/1214341022/president-biden-went-to-norfolk-va-for-a-friendsgiving\" target=\"_blank\">sitting president</a> among its participants in 2023. There are no official statistics on how many Americans celebrate Friendsgiving, but <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/green-giant-survey-finds-nearly-1-in-2-americans-will-celebrate-friendsgiving-this-year-301989365.html\" target=\"_blank\">online surveys</a> from recent years suggest numbers could be <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/28817/thanksgiving-plans-gcs/?srsltid=AfmBOooRu6kYEM7m4isciyeD3XgD6HuRC05SdaVibRor7M3wex8uDHqp\" target=\"_blank\">as high as 20%</a>. Brewster wonders whether we are seeing more Friendsgiving gatherings at least in part because there is now a name for them. It doesn't hurt that it's a catchy \"blend word,\" which she says Americans especially get a kick out of (see: \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/07/21/1189062921/barbie-oppenheimer-barbenheimer-movie-double-feature\" target=\"_blank\">Barbenheimer</a>\" or \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/13/694463692/how-galentines-day-went-from-a-sitcom-hit-to-a-commercial-holiday\" target=\"_blank\">Galentine's Day</a>\"). \"I'm curious … if the existence of the word has somehow generated more of this kind of socializing,\" she adds. \"I think words do have that power, that they can actually influence action.\" <h3>\"Friendsgiving\" isn't one-size-fits-all </h3> Lizzie Post, the co-president of the Emily Post Institute, says the etiquette-focused organization started getting questions about Friendsgiving do's and don'ts around the time the word entered the lexicon. \"They were questions along the lines of: 'Is it OK to host Friendsgiving and go to your family Thanksgiving?' 'Can you only do Friendsgiving if your family isn't around and you can't travel to them?' \" she explains. The answer turned out to be a resounding yes. Many of those who celebrate Friendsgiving typically do so in addition to their family Thanksgiving, not instead of it. \"I think Friendsgiving is a nice way to be able to do both,\" says Emily Stephenson, a cookbook author whose work includes <em>The Friendsgiving Handbook</em>, published in 2019. Stephenson says she has been hosting Friendsgiving — even though she never called it by that name — for about two decades, starting when she attended college abroad. \"It kind of implies … a younger person who's maybe doing things that's not going to be super traditional,\" she says. \"And I do think part of what's implied in Friendsgiving is maybe it being the first time you host.\" To Stephenson, younger generations' embrace of Friendsgiving makes perfect sense, particularly after the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throwing a dinner party can be a rare and special experience, especially for 20-something apartment dwellers who are potentially many years away from hosting a family Thanksgiving. And there's not one right way to do it, considering the holiday is made-up and the real thing is just around the corner. Stephenson says that hopefully takes some pressure off. \"If you are hosting and a turkey stresses you out, you don't need to make turkey,\" she adds. Post says these days, most of the questions the institute gets about Friendsgiving revolve around the etiquette of potlucks. The most important thing, she says, is to make clear who is responsible for what. \"I think that as people, we really value spending time with one another, taking a break from the everyday,\" Post says. \"And whether that means eating off of paper plates … in front of a football game on the couch with a big buffet behind us, or whether that's a formally set table, matters not. It's the gathering that makes the big difference.\" <h3>Tips for your next Friendsgiving </h3> That said, there are things both hosts and guests should keep in mind to help make Friendsgiving as easy as pie. Here's some of the best advice we got from Post and Stephenson: <strong>For hosts:</strong> <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Do</strong> ask people if they have allergies or dietary restrictions beforehand. <br></li></ul><ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Do</strong> keep track of who is bringing what, whether you assign specific dishes or leave guests to fill out a shared spreadsheet. And if someone shows up with something that wasn't on the list, serve it anyway. <br></li></ul><ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Do</strong> take responsibility for the main dish — but it doesn't have to be a full turkey. Stephenson suggests preparing a less time-consuming turkey leg or breast, or skipping the bird altogether in favor of something like a shepherd's pie, savory galette or lasagna. <br></li></ul><ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Do</strong> make it easier for out-of-town guests by tasking them with store-bought contributions, like drinks, napkins or a premade crudité platter.  <br></li></ul><ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Do</strong> give guests key details in advance, like what time the meal will actually be served (especially on a weekend) and a dress code if you're planning a more formal event. <br></li></ul><ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Don't</strong> be afraid to ask guests to help out. Post recalls that when her mom used to host some two dozen Thanksgiving guests, she would ask people to not only bring a dish but sign up for a job — from setting out place cards to lighting candles to checking who wants ice cream with their pie. \"Some people faint when I say this,\" Post laughs. \"But … little tasks like that, when spread out over the whole group, not only make it a little bit even more of a communal experience, but they help ease the burden on the host.\"</li></ul><ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Do</strong> try to send guests home with leftovers of the dish they brought. \"Just because they've brought it to your house doesn't automatically make it yours,\" Post says. If they don't want it, transfer it into another container so you can clean their original dish and send it home with them. <br></li></ul> <strong>For guests:</strong> <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Do</strong> inform the host of any dietary restrictions (if they don't ask), but do so \"with an offer to bring something that meets your needs,\" Post says.  </li></ul> <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Don't</strong> arrive empty-handed. \"I don't think there's many rules for being a guest besides … don't make soup,\" Stephenson says, since it adds another round of dishes to clean. </li></ul> <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Do</strong> the heavy lifting before you leave the house. Since kitchen space will be limited, it's best to bring a dish that is ready to eat, even if it needs a few minutes in the oven first. </li></ul> <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Don't</strong> show up expecting leftovers, though of course it's nice if you end up with some. </li></ul> <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li><strong>Do</strong> remember to thank your host — verbally is fine, Post says. If your friends are into group activities, you may well get a chance to share what you're thankful for anyway.</li></ul>",

Formed almost four decades ago, the rock band's artistic ambition has always been connection — pop anthems that can be blasted from car speakers and in karaoke bars, and sung en masse. These songs stick around, but never wear out their welcome. This set is bookended by songs from <em>Dizzy Up the Girl</em>, the 1998 album that found the sweet spot between catchy arena rockers and heartfelt power ballads. \"Slide\" is particularly suited to the space as John Rzeznik's voice, which has aged gracefully into the velvet rasp he's known for, rings clearly across the song's careening melody. \"Feel the Silence\" is a sturdy and perhaps little-known gem from 2006's <em>Let Love In</em>. \"Not Goodbye (Close My Eyes),\" too, is a meditative ballad waiting to find more ears. But how could Goo Goo Dolls not close with \"Iris\"? Originally written for the <em>City of Angels</em> soundtrack, revived by <em>Deadpool & Wolverine</em> and consistently discovered by listeners seen by its romantic melodrama, \"Iris\" has returned from the brink of winking irony and been once again embraced for its desperate sincerity.

    "title": "How a small Chicago nonprofit is resisting Trump's war on DEI",
    "text": "CHICAGO — On a warm fall day, thousands of female construction workers joined a mile-long parade, joyously celebrating gains they've made in an industry still dominated by men. It was the marquee event of the annual Tradeswomen Build Nations conference. The women marched, sang and rang cowbells, proudly sporting their union t-shirts and carrying banners announcing their trades: plumbing, pipefitting, roofing, drywall finishing and many more. Leading the parade in fluorescent vests and hardhats was a drumline made up of a dozen or so staff from the nonprofit Chicago Women in Trades. \"This is amazing to see what it has grown into,\" says Lauren Sugerman, who worked as an elevator constructor in the 1980s before spending the bulk of her career at Chicago Women in Trades. \"To see the sisterhood that has been built is so empowering.\" But behind the celebration are grave concerns that the organization, which has been breaking down barriers for women in the construction industry since Ronald Reagan was president, could be brought down by President Trump. As Trump wages a war against diversity, equity and inclusion or DEI, Chicago Women in Trades is fighting back in court, both for its own preservation and for the movement. <h3>Trump's all-out effort to end DEI</h3> Hours after Trump took office, he signed a pair of executive orders cracking down on what he said was widespread and illegal use of \"dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.\" His orders called on <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/\" target=\"_blank\">government agencies to cease DEI-related work</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\">directed government contractors and grantees</a> to end their programs promoting it. Trump also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5332213/jobs-women-trump-dei-civil-rights\" target=\"_blank\">rescinded a 1965 executive order</a>, signed by former President Lyndon B. Johnson, that required federal contractors and subcontractors to take proactive steps to ensure they weren't violating federal anti-discrimination laws.  Trump promised a renewed emphasis on merit, replacing what he called a \"pernicious identity-based spoils system.\" Here's why that's a problem for Chicago Women in Trades: The organization was founded in 1981 in response to Johnson's executive order and a subsequent Labor Department requirement — also now gone — that federal contractors make good faith efforts to get women onto construction sites. Its stated mission is to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, including by recruiting women and helping them qualify and compete for high-wage union construction jobs.  Some 70% of its participants are Black and Latina. As of January, roughly 40% of its annual budget came from U.S. Labor Department grants. <h3>What is illegal DEI? Lots of threats but no clarity</h3> While the loss of federal grants would be devastating, perhaps even more damaging to Chicago Women in Trades is the certification provision tucked inside one of Trump's executive orders. Going forward, federal contractors and grantees must certify that they are not operating programs \"promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\" Anyone found to have knowingly reported false information could face steep civil and criminal penalties, according to the executive order. \"There's a lot of threats out there but no clarity on what is illegal DEI,\" says Chicago Women in Trades Executive Director Jayne Vellinga. \"It is unclear how the industry or anyone is going to respond to it.\" It's a conundrum that puts the nonprofit in a precarious position. Chicago Women in Trades works closely with labor unions and contractors to ensure the women they recruit and train can get into apprenticeship programs to grow their careers. Would unions and contractors now sever those relationships if forced to certify that they're not engaging in illegal DEI? Without those established systems, Vellinga fears hard-won gains for women could be lost. \"We have an administration that is trying to turn back the clock on progress it has taken decades to achieve,\" says Vellinga. In a statement to NPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai pushed back. \"Instead of DEI boondoggles that accomplish nothing, the Trump administration is laying the groundwork for Americans of all backgrounds to help build our next Golden Age,\" Desai wrote, pointing to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/preparing-americans-for-high-paying-skilled-trade-jobs-of-the-future/\" target=\"_blank\">another executive order Trump signed</a> that aims to boost the country's skilled trades workforce. Trump has pledged to support 1 million new registered apprenticeships per year and says a plan for doing so is forthcoming. <h3>Women-focused programs have changed lives</h3> Talk to female construction workers around Chicago and you get a sense for how Chicago Women in Trades has long worked to achieve those same goals. Second-year plumbing apprentices Kaitlyn Truty, Charlie Willoughby and Juliet Silvestre credit the nonprofit with getting them into their careers. \"I 100% believe so,\" says Truty. All three women came through the organization's free, 10-week training program, where they got an introduction to the gamut of construction trades and learned basic skills such as tool handling and blueprint reading. \"We had to work out as well,\" says Willoughby, recalling the morning gym sessions. As part of an assessment to enter the plumbers union, they had to lift an 80-pound box onto a shelf over their heads. Chicago Women in Trades brought in plumbers to teach them how to do it. \"It was so intimidating,\" says Truty. \"I couldn't do more than two pushups walking in, and I walked out … being able to do 50-plus pushups in one go, and I lifted that box.\" The apprentices say having a community of women around them helped them believe that they were up to the task and prepared them for the challenges they would face as females in the industry. Even now, they say they are often the only woman on a job site. \"The people in your family don't understand what you're going through, but another tradeswoman can relate to you,\" says Silvestre. \"They understand me.\" <h3>The carpenters union ends \"Sisters in the Brotherhood\"</h3> Already, one building trades union has taken steps to avoid running afoul of Trump's executive orders. Earlier this year, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, representing more than a half million workers in North America, disbanded its Sisters in the Brotherhood program. For more than a quarter century, the program gave women carpenters a space to build networks and share ideas for how to overcome barriers. In a memo, Douglas McCarron, the union's general president, wrote that current policies targeting identity-based initiatives put the program at legal risk. It's been replaced with an engagement program, open to all members. \"It's very ironic that you can have a 'Brotherhood of Carpenters' which references brothers, but you can't have – because of DEI – a 'Sisters in the Brotherhood,'\" says Kina McAfee, a retired union carpenter who is now on staff at Chicago Women in Trades. \"I don't understand it. And it will impact our ability to get women into the trades in the future.\" The union did not respond to NPR's questions about the change. <h3>Awaiting a major ruling</h3> Already, Chicago Women in Trades' lawsuit challenging Trump's anti-DEI executive orders has brought the nonprofit some protection. In April, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in the Northern District of Illinois preemptively blocked the termination of one of the nonprofit's federal grants. Kennelly also blocked the certification provision in Trump's executive order for Labor Department contractors and grantees nationwide, after finding that Chicago Women in Trades was likely to prove it would suffer irreparable harm should the provision stand. The Trump administration has appealed that part of Kennelly's decision to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. In court briefs, the administration has argued that the provision merely requires grantees to verify that they won't violate existing federal anti-discrimination laws. The court is expected to hold a hearing on the matter, though a date has not been set. As Vellinga awaits a ruling, she says it's hard to imagine what the future will look like. \"We feel like we're in limbo,\" she says. Particularly vexing to Vellinga is that Chicago Women in Trades is fighting this battle at a time when women still make up less than 5% of the skilled trades workforce nationwide. \"You cannot look at the workforce of the construction trades and say, 'Oh, they've taken DEI too far,'\" she says with a rueful laugh. \"You look at the workforce of the construction trades and you see we have a long way to go.\"<br>",

    "title": "Trump's National Guard deployments face mounting legal pushback",
    "text": "Again and again, President Trump's efforts to send National Guard troops to U.S. cities have been met with resistance in the courts. In his second term, Trump has continued to push the boundaries of military involvement in domestic matters, whether it comes to addressing public safety, quelling protests or safeguarding federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents. In response, local and state Democratic leaders have forcefully pushed back and made strides in the courts, where judges have deemed the use of military force as unnecessary or unlawful. Some judges have also expressed wariness around having the military get involved in civilian affairs. \"This principle has been foundational to the safeguarding of our fundamental liberties under the Constitution,\" U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote in her ruling freezing Trump's deployment to Portland, Ore. earlier this month. The latest court to push back was in Washington, D.C. where a federal judge ruled on Thursday that Trump's use of the Guard in the nation's capital <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615399/dc-troops-deployment-blocked-trump\" target=\"_blank\">was unlawful</a>. Days earlier, a judge in Tennessee temporarily blocked the state's deployment in Memphis, where troops had been ordered by the governor at the behest of Trump. As the legal challenges mount, the Defense Department over the weekend ordered hundreds of troops in Chicago and Portland to return to their home states after federal courts stalled deployments, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/16/nx-s1-5610485/national-guard-chicago-portland-texas-california\" target=\"_blank\"><u>NPR previously reported</u></a>. Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the Trump administration has now been rebuffed by federal district or state judges in all five cities where Guard troops have been deployed.  \"Although the cases are still working their way through the appeals process, it is increasingly clear that Trump's actions are not just unprecedented but also unlawful,\" she said. \"Using the military against Americans absent the gravest of emergencies goes against centuries of tradition and legal principles.\" Some legal and military experts view the recent events as minor setbacks for the Trump administration. But others see the court decisions as proof of checks and balances at work, at least to some degree. \"There's a pretty common theme that deploying the military into U.S. cities is not something that can be done lawlessly,\" said David Janovsky, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. \"It is a good sign that the courts are standing up and saying that.\" <h3><strong>Breaking down the Memphis ruling </strong></h3> In Tennessee, a group of Democratic lawmakers and officials filed a lawsuit against Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard. The plaintiffs argued that Memphis did not face a \"rebellion or invasion,\" which was the criteria for sending the Guard under the state's constitution. Unlike the governors of Illinois, Oregon and California, who have opposed Trump's deployment of Guard forces, the governor of Tennessee approved and directed the deployment in Memphis.  Still, on Monday, Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal sided with the plaintiffs. In her opinion, she wrote, \"The power committed to the Governor as commander-in-chief of the Army and Militia is not unfettered.\" Benjamin R. Farley, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, which<strong> </strong>was part of a coalition that provided legal representation to the plaintiffs,<strong> </strong>said Moskal's ruling showed that the Tennessee governor does not have blanket authority to deploy troops.  \"It's one more victory in a line of victories for the law against executive overreach, whether that's the president or as is the case here, the governor of Tennessee,\" he said. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NPR that the administration disagreed with the ruling. \"This state court judge fundamentally misunderstood the law and is attempting to act as a policy-maker, not a judge,\" she said in an email. Now, it's important to note that the pause on the deployment has not taken effect, as the chancellor gave the state a few days to appeal. In a statement, Lee spokesperson Elizabeth Lane Johnson said the state will appeal and the Guard will continue to operate in the city. \"Memphians know their city is facing a violent crime emergency that the state must address, and we're confident higher courts will ultimately recognize this as well,\" she said. Janovsky from the Project on Government Oversight said allowing the Guard operations to continue is one way the courts tend to fall short. \"That sort of misreads the stakes of the situation,\" he said. \"If it is presumptively illegal to have troops on the streets, it seems completely backwards to let the troops stay on the street until there's a final determination.\" <h3><strong>As federal courts block troop deployments, will SCOTUS have final say?</strong></h3> A Defense Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that the holidays may have influenced the decision to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/16/nx-s1-5610485/national-guard-chicago-portland-texas-california\" target=\"_blank\"><u>withdraw out-of-state troops from Illinois and Oregon</u></a> in the coming days. But retired Maj. Gen. William Enyart, who led the Illinois National Guard from 2007 to 2012, believes the federal courts, which have repeatedly blocked the deployments in Chicago and Portland from moving forward, also played a role. \"This shows the relative strength of the system and of the founding fathers in designing that system, where we had a separation of powers as well as a balancing of powers,\" he added. The Trump administration is challenging the rulings that block the use of troops and in the case over the deployment in Chicago, the administration has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. Some legal experts say it could have a ripple effect — to a degree — depending on how broadly the justices rule. \"The more broadly they construe their opinion, the more broad of an effect we're going to see,\" said Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Even as debates over the mobilizations play out in various courts, Trump has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/10/nx-s1-5567177/national-guard-map-chicago-california-oregon\" target=\"_blank\"><u>suggested sending troops</u></a> to about half a dozen other cities, and warned of invoking the Insurrection Act to pave the way. Mirasola said there are limits to how much the courts can restrict the president's use of the military, and ultimately the public serves as a stronger check on power. \"It's always going to be public sentiment that I think is especially consequential,\" he said.",

    "title": "Poll: Democrats have biggest advantage for control of Congress in 8 years",
    "text": "Heading into the 2026 midterm elections, there are some very big warning signs for Republicans in the latest <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/a-look-to-the-2026-midterms-november-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">NPR/PBS News/Marist poll</a>. The survey of 1,443 adults, conducted from Nov. 10-13, found: <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li>Democrats holding their largest advantage, 14 points, since 2017 on the question of who respondents would vote for if the midterm elections were held today;</li><li>President Trump's approval rating is just 39%, his lowest since right after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol;</li><li>A combined 6-in-10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/15/nx-s1-5609367/trump-government-shutdown-what-to-know-longest\" target=\"_blank\">government shutdown</a>; and </li><li>Nearly 6-in-10 say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices — and no other issue comes close.</li></ul> \"I don't think rent prices or food prices are at the forefront like they should be,\" said Nicole Stokes of Dallas, Texas, who participated in NPR's poll and voted for Trump last year. \"You know — the American people — it's our pockets that are getting ripped apart to fund things.\" From the political parties and Congress to the Supreme Court and the media, other respondents said they had little to no confidence in these critical institutions. \"I feel lost,\" said poll respondent Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tenn., who calls himself a \"lapsed Democrat.\" \"The parties don't speak to me anymore.\" He said he often feels unseen by the Democratic Party, but, given the alternative, he plans to keep supporting Democratic candidates — for now. The disillusionment extends to how people see those in the opposite political party. Big majorities of Democrats and Republicans said the other party is \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\" about politics. All of it makes for a volatile political stew heading into the holidays, but with Republicans in charge of all the levers of power in Washington, Democrats have the clear advantage a year out from next year's midterm elections. <h3>Democrats in the driver's seat for control of Congress</h3> Coming off huge wins up and down the ballot across the country in this year's off-year elections, Democrats lead Republicans, 55%-41%, when people were asked who they would vote for in their district if the election for Congress were held today. It's the largest Democratic advantage on this question, known as the congressional ballot, in the Marist poll since November 2017. The parallel is striking, considering that was at the same point in Trump's first term as this poll now. Democrats wound up winning 40 House seats in 2018. What's more, independents chose Democrats by a 33-point margin on this question. It's all quite the reversal of fortune from a year ago when, just before the 2024 elections when President Trump won back the White House, the parties were tied on the congressional ballot. Historically, Democrats have needed a sizable advantage on the congressional ballot to signal that they would do well in upcoming midterms. Consider:<br> <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\"><li>In the fall of 2022, with Democratic President Biden in the White House, Democrats' lead ranged from 0 to 4 points. They <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/seats-congress-gainedlost-the-presidents-party-mid-term-elections\" target=\"_blank\">lost nine House seats</a>;</li><li>In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats' lead ranged between 6 and 12. They won 40 seats; </li><li>In 2014, when Democrat Barack Obama was president, Republicans had a 5-point advantage. The GOP gained 13 seats.<br></li></ul> All that said, with redistricting, the <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">number of competitive seats</a> has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/05/29/1100980188/u-s-house-loses-more-swing-in-2022\" target=\"_blank\">shrunk significantly</a>, so major gains are less likely than they were in previous years. Trump has also encouraged conservatives in red states to try and create more Republican districts in rare mid-decade redistricting. Democrats have responded in kind, so the landscape for control of the House for next year remains uncertain at this point. <h3>The Trump drag on the GOP</h3> A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular. Not only is he at 39% approval, the lowest of this second term in the Marist poll, but he gets just a 24% rating with independents as well. Overall, almost half of those surveyed — 48% — said they <em>strongly</em> disapprove of the job the president is doing. That's also the highest of this term and the highest since just after Jan. 6, 2021. The president has seen low ratings for his handling of various policy areas, including the <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/issues/economy\" target=\"_blank\">economy</a> and <a href=\"https://instituteforglobalaffairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IGA-2025-US-Public-Opinion-Survey-Reckless-Peacemaker.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">foreign policy</a>, and people think he's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/us/trump-deportation-illegal-immigrants-voters-poll.html\" target=\"_blank\">gone too far</a> on immigration. Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/01/nx-s1-5282353/trump-economy-prices-inflation\" target=\"_blank\">has said</a> on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/01/nx-s1-5282353/trump-economy-prices-inflation\" target=\"_blank\">more than one occasion</a> in this second term that while campaign advisers told him prices were the most important issue, he always felt it was really immigration. But respondents in the NPR survey are sending a clear message: they think the cost of living should be Trump's top priority. Almost 6-in-10 — 57% — said lowering prices should be his top priority. Immigration is a distant second at 16%. Even a plurality of Republicans (40%) said lowering prices should be the priority compared to immigration (34%). Despite Trump's slide in approval ratings, he's holding up well with his base — 9-in-10 Republicans continue to say they approve of the job he's doing. Stokes, the Trump voter from Dallas, said a year into his presidency, said she's pleased by his attempts to tackle illegal border crossings and restrict U.S. foreign aid, but she is concerned that the president hasn't made the economy a focus. But her support of Trump doesn't translate to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party. \"They're not in tune with anyone on the ground,\" Stokes said. \"I don't really see anyone in [the House] or in the Senate that's really for the American people right now.\" <h3>It's not just Trump. Democrats and others get low marks</h3> Trump's approval is low and so is confidence in the office he holds — 61% said they have little to no confidence in the institution of the presidency. But the scores were even poorer for other key institutions. Worst among them was Congress — 80% said they had little to no confidence in it, followed by the media (75%), the Democratic Party (71%), the Republican Party (65%) and the Supreme Court (62%). This is yet another poll that shows Democrats have a problem with their base. While 80% of Republicans have \"quite a lot\" or a \"great deal\" of confidence in the GOP, just 57% of Democrats said the same of their party. Despite long supporting liberal candidates, Dowdy, the Democrat from Memphis, argues the party has become disconnected from everyday voters. \"They don't interact with working people,\" he said, \"regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or building homes or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live... They have no connection to the real people. And there's no attempt to try and reach that.\" And yet, Democrats have a wide advantage on the congressional ballot, which, coupled with the electoral gains earlier this month, indicate that left-leaning voters may rally to Democrats' side when faced with having to choose between them and Republicans. <h3>Democrats and Republicans see each other as \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\"</h3> It's no wonder political acrimony is as high as it is in the country; people have very little respect for where the other side is coming from. The survey found that more than 8-in-10 Republicans and Democrats described people in the other political party as \"closed-minded\"; more than 7-in-10 Republicans and roughly two-thirds of Democrats also see the other as \"dishonest\" when talking about politics. Independents have better views of Democrats than Republicans. They said Republicans were more dishonest and closed-minded than Democrats with a majority of independents (54%) saying Republicans were \"mostly dishonest\" compared to more than 6-in-10 saying Democrats were \"mostly honest\" when it came to politics. Nearly 7-in-10 independents also described Republicans as mostly closed-minded, while a majority (53%) said Democrats were mostly open-minded.",

    "text": "Pop music is full of references to denim — from the opening lyrics of Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer\" — \"Blue jean baby\" — to Flo Rida's ode to an Apple Bottoms pair in \"Low.\" But musicians don't just sing about jeans. They also live in them. And those garments sometimes reveal intriguing details about the people who wear them, as the new <a href=\"https://www.levistrauss.com/2025/11/05/levis-vault-reopens/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Amped: Music Icons in Levi's Denim</em></a> exhibition at Levi's headquarters in San Francisco shows. One of the exhibition's marquee items is a pair of Levi's 501s once owned by Kurt Cobain. The late Nirvana frontman's jeans set a <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-expensive-jeans\" target=\"_blank\">Guinness World Record</a> in 2023 when they sold for more than $412,750 at a Nashville <a href=\"https://www.juliensauctions.com/en/items/97928/nirvana-kurt-cobain-photo-matched-stage-worn-heart-shaped-box-video-worn-and-mtv-awards-event-worn-l\" target=\"_blank\">auction</a>. Tracey Panek was there. \"I was bidding on it,\" Levi's in-house historian and archivist told NPR. \"But sadly one of my rivals got it.\" The winning bidder, private collector Tom Coyne, agreed to loan the jeans to Levi's for the exhibition. Cobain wore them on many occasions during the 1990s, including on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6P0SitRwy8\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> for \"Heart-Shaped Box.\" They show a lot of wear. There are heavy stains, rips and patches, including a colorful psychedelic print lining the hem. \"They're just a signature grunge-looking pair of jeans,\" Panek said. The pants also tell more subtle stories. Panek points to faded, upside-down lettering on the right leg — a four-letter word beginning with F — scribbled on a patch. While the artist was famously a left-handed guitarist, Panek said the scrawl suggests Cobain was actually ambidextrous. \"You can tell he was writing with his right hand while he was seated,\" she said. Other pieces in the exhibition offer very different portraits of their famous owners. The sharp creases in a pair of slim-fitting, light blue jeans once owned by Freddie Mercury say something about the Queen vocalist's fastidiousness. \"I think he ironed these,\" Panek said. Meanwhile a rhinestone-festooned, western-style denim pants and matching jacket worn by Beyoncé in a recent Levi's advertising campaign highlight Queen Bey's penchant as a performer for upending traditional white, male tropes. \"She challenges a pool shark to a shootout,\" said Panek, describing one of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2o2FuqMtxI\" target=\"_blank\">ads</a> set to Beyoncé's 2024 song \"Levii's Jeans.\" \"Of course, she wins hands down, and demands that her rival give up his Levi's.\" Mary Davis, a fashion historian and musicologist at Yale University, said musicians use denim in many different ways to construct identity and share messages. \"There's a way in which you can see denim being almost a blank canvas for anything that anybody wants to make it,\" Davis said. Davis points to Bruce Springsteen's 1984 album <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em>, with its songs about the struggles of the working class – and its memorable album cover. It shows Springsteen from behind in worn blue Levi's, a white T-shirt and a red baseball cap stuffed into a back pocket. Davis said the photograph draws a potent line between denim's 19th century workwear roots and the troubadour of late twentieth century labor. \"He's making a statement there,\" Davis said. <h2>Songs About Jeans</h2> <em>A new exhibit in San Francisco about pop star denim inspired us to make a playlist featuring our favorite songs about bell bottoms, hip huggers and jean jackets.</em>",

    "title": "What to know about the F-35 fighter jet that Trump is selling to Saudi Arabia",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he has agreed to sell the nation's most advanced fighter jet to Saudi Arabia despite concerns that China could gain access to the plane's vaunted American technology. The sale to the Middle Eastern nation, whose top trading partner is China, was reaffirmed Tuesday during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Washington. Some in the Republican administration also have been wary that selling the F-35 to Saudi Arabia will upset Israel's qualitative military edge over its neighbors, especially at a time when Trump is depending on Israeli support for the success of his Gaza peace plan. Israel, which deployed the F-35 in its 12-day war against Iran in June, is among 19 other nations that already have the plane or have agreements to buy it. It was nearly 20 years ago when the first F-35 Lightning strike fighter rolled off an assembly line in Fort Worth, Texas, hailed as a technological leap and lamented as a military money pit. Since then, more than 1,200 of the stealth jets have been made, underpinning what Lockheed Martin says are nearly 300,000 jobs connected to its supply chain across 49 states and Puerto Rico. The planes have been delivered to the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. Here are things to know about the F-35: <h3>The fighter jet is coveted by many</h3> Marines used the F-35 to execute strikes against enemy targets in Afghanistan, while Italian F-35s were part of a NATO response in September to Russian aircraft in Estonian airspace. But the stubby-nosed aircraft with twin tail fins has been criticized since its inception, in part because it was designed to serve the varying needs of three different military branches. For example, the Navy launches them off aircraft carriers, while the Marines Corps' version can take off and land like a helicopter. It is the most expensive Pentagon spending program ever — they cost up to $77 million a piece in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service — while they have been famously beset with cost overruns and delays. Meanwhile, China may have at least some intelligence, albeit several years old, on the planes already. The Defense Science Board, which advises the Pentagon, released a report in 2013 alleging that Chinese cyberattacks accessed data from dozens of Pentagon programs, including the joint strike fighter. <h3>The most advanced US fighter jet</h3> The F-35 is \"widely recognized as America's best and most advanced fighter jet,\" according to Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Bowman noted that American military systems are constantly being updated and improved, counteracting any possible stolen secrets years ago. \"That's why you have 19 partner nations already and why countries like Saudi Arabia want it,\" Bowman said. \"If the aircraft was so compromised because of theft from the Chinese, the Saudis wouldn't want it.\" First proposed in the 1990s, the F-35 was meant to replace several aging fighters, including the Air Force's workhorse F-16. The plane was designed to allow pilots to easily shift from bombing runs to aerial combat on the same mission. Described as a fifth-generation fighter, its technologies include stealth coatings as well as advanced radar and sensors, according to the Congressional Research Service. \"What makes the F-35 particularly formidable is the increased difficulty our adversaries have in detecting it,\" Bowman said. \"So if you can't see it, you can't kill it.\" Bowman said the plane also has advanced sensors to better detect enemies as well as networking capabilities to communicate with allied planes and ground forces during combat. Each plane was supposed to be relatively cheap to build, with each variation constructed on the same assembly line. But as the first F-35 prepared for its inaugural flight in 2006, the program's cost had grown substantially. <h3>High costs for the aircraft</h3> According to a September report from the Government Accountability Office, a Defense Department estimate said maintaining, operating and modernizing the planned 2,470 planes over a 77-year life cycle will exceed $2 trillion. The report also found that Lockheed delivered 110 aircraft last year, all of which \"were late by an average of 238 days, up from 61 days in 2023.\" Meanwhile, there have been concerns about readiness. In 2023, the rate at which the aircraft can perform one of its tasked missions was about 55%, far below program goals, the Government Accountability Office found. Part of the problem was delays in setting up maintenance facilities, inadequate equipment and supply issues. Dan Grazier, a senior fellow and director of the National Security Reform Program at the Stimson Center, said the F-35 program has ultimately been a failure. He pointed to the aircraft's stealth coating to evade radar detection, which he said requires a lot of maintenance, while a camera system to provide situational awareness also has had problems. \"It does not matter what kind of transformational combat capability an aircraft has if it cannot be relied upon,\" he said, The F-35 was designed to replace several different older airplanes at once, Grazier said, noting that it does \"a lot of things kind of well, but it doesn't do anything great.\" \"It also costs a fortune,\" he said. \"So you pay a fortune for an aircraft that is actually in many cases less capable than what came before it.\" Lockheed Martin pushed back on such criticisms. \"The F-35 is the cornerstone of the battlespace for 20 allied nations, enabling peace through strength,\" the company said in a statement. \"It is combat proven and offers the most advanced capability and technology. With more than 1 million hours flown and more than 1,255 aircraft in service, the F-35 is an indispensable contributor to global security.",

When we're at the grocery store or the coffee shop, are we paying more for things because of the tariffs? We now have the data to get a very clear answer to that question.

    "text": "SIDON, Lebanon — An Israeli airstrike on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon on Tuesday killed 13 people and wounded several others, state media and government officials said. It was the deadliest strike on Lebanon since a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago. The drone strike hit a car in the parking lot of a mosque in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of the coastal city of Sidon, the state-run National News Agency said. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 13 people were killed and several others wounded in the airstrike, without giving further details. Hamas fighters in the area prevented journalists from reaching the scene, as ambulances rushed to evacuate the wounded and the dead. The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas training compound that was being used to prepare an attack against Israel and its army. It added that the Israeli army would continue to act against Hamas wherever the group operates. Hamas condemned the attack in a statement saying the strike hit a sports playground and denying that it was a training compound. Over the past two years, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed scores of officials from the militant Hezbollah group as well as Palestinian factions such as Hamas. Saleh Arouri, the deputy political head of Hamas and a founder of the group's military wing, was killed in a drone strike on a southern suburb of Beirut on Jan. 2, 2024. Several other Hamas officials have been killed in strikes since then. Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. That sparked Israel's offensive on the Gaza Strip that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. A day after the Israel-Hamas war started, Hezbollah began firing rockets toward Israeli posts along the border. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes in Lebanon, and the two sides became locked in an escalating conflict that became a full-blown war in late September 2024. That war, the most recent of several conflicts involving Hezbollah over the past four decades, killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction, according to the World Bank. In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers. The war ended in late November 2024 with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Since then, Israel has carried out scores of airstrikes in Lebanon, saying that Hezbollah is trying to rebuild its capabilities. Lebanon's Health Ministry has reported more than 270 people killed and around 850 wounded by Israeli military actions since the ceasefire.",

The <a href=\"https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20250115\" target=\"_blank\">findings were published</a> in the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry </em>on Wednesday — and are sure to raise questions about the merits of swapping one of these substances for another, especially given growing concern in the public health field about the popularity of cannabis. And the researchers are cautious about making any recommendations based on their findings at this point. \"We're not ready to tell people seeking treatment for alcohol, go ahead and substitute cannabis, and it will work out for you,\" says <a href=\"https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jmetrik\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Metrik</a>, a professor of behavioral and social science at Brown University who led the study. But the research does bring scientists closer to understanding the link between these two substances, at a time when many people are leaning on marijuana to cut back on drinking, without waiting for the evidence. \"This study really moves the field forward by helping to resolve one of the unresolved questions in the literature,\" says <a href=\"https://health.yorku.ca/health-profiles/?mid=1895430\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Wardell</a>, a professor of psychology at York University. \"This gives us more confidence that there's a real effect here.\" <h3>Getting high for science</h3> In the Brown study, the team took pains to replicate the real-life circumstances of getting stoned and drinking, while still maintaining a tightly controlled study that could point toward a causal relationship. They constructed a laboratory that resembles a bar, with comfy seats and a tap, and ensured each participant had their preferred alcoholic beverage on hand. \"We wanted to make sure that when given the opportunity, you would be really driven to drink,\" says Metrik, who ended up spending substantial time shuttling between liquor stores looking for special vintages and spirits. The experiment included three separate sessions. In one of them, participants smoked a marijuana joint with higher levels of the psychoactive compound, THC; in another they used a lower potency strain; and the last, researchers gave them a placebo with a trace amount of THC that wasn't enough to get them high. After toking up in a designated smoking room, each participant spent the next two hours in the \"bar lab\" on their own where they had the opportunity to drink up to eight mini drinks. The people who smoked the higher potency cannabis ended up drinking 27% less alcohol, and the lower potency about 19% less, compared to the placebo. People who used cannabis also delayed their drinking. \"It is an important signal that we're detecting,\" says Metrik. \"It is telling us that cannabinoids could play a potential therapeutic role in alcohol use disorder.\" Previous research has suggested that cannabis may reduce alcohol cravings and how much people drink. But the results have been largely inconclusive, in part because the data often come from observational studies, which are less reliable and can be muddied by other factors. Animal studies have also indicated potential biological mechanisms behind weed's effect on alcohol; however, there's a question of how much this applies to humans. The new study also builds on what a team of researchers in Colorado <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871625003138\" target=\"_blank\">reported earlier this year</a> in a slightly different experiment. There, participants instead picked up their marijuana from a dispensary, smoked it at home and then visited a mobile lab parked nearby, where they were offered alcoholic beverages. The amount people ended up drinking dropped by about 25% when they were already stoned. Cravings also went down. \"These findings are all converging on a similar story,\" says <a href=\"https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/39978\" target=\"_blank\">Hollis Karoly</a>, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz who led the study. But she points out there are still big questions about how much you can extrapolate from this new evidence.  <h3>Replacing one problem with another?</h3> One obvious limitation is that how someone behaves when every sip they are taking is under close observation may not necessarily reflect what happens in a much looser, real-world social setting. And beyond that, Karoly says this pattern toward reduced alcohol consumption wasn't true for everyone in their study. In a minority of people, it actually led them to drink <em>more</em>. \"This really highlights the fact that individual differences matter,\" she says. Another unanswered question centers on who's being studied. Most of the people in the Brown trial met the criteria for \"cannabis use disorder,\" and about 40% for alcohol use disorder. That could indicate their \"drug of choice\" was not necessarily alcohol in the first place, says <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/rajita-sinha/\" target=\"_blank\">Rajita Sinha</a>, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University. For people with problem drinking, cannabis <em>might</em> be a potential treatment, she says. This approach, on the other hand, \"may also be promoting more cannabis use and that would be problematic.\" \"Once you're in the throes of daily cannabis use, it's very hard to kick that habit,\" she says. Those involved in this work acknowledge the tension in this line of research. Cannabis doesn't carry the same risks of extreme harm as alcohol, which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/facts-stats/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">is a leading cause</a> of preventable death in the U.S and kills more than 170,000 people a year. But Wardell says cannabis is clearly \"not a harm-free substance,\" either. While research on its effect has not kept up with its surging popularity, studies have shown marijuana can impair cognition and memory, trigger a serious gastrointestinal syndrome that causes nausea and vomiting, increase the risk of psychosis and other psychiatric illness, and impact relationships and social functioning. And Wardell says this latest study doesn't actually tell us whether the negative outcomes of alcohol are worse than cannabis in the long run. \"We would have to choose which one for a given individual might be less harmful and make sure that it's not inadvertently just replacing one problem with another,\" he says. In her role as a clinical psychologist, Metrik at Brown has seen     some patients with severe alcoholism who successfully stopped drinking with the help of cannabis, though some have then gone on to develop issues with that drug.   In her mind, the problem right now is that many people are relying on cannabis to treat their alcohol problems, without any guidance. \"We see this all the time, and we don't know what to tell them,\" she says. \"There's no clear messaging,",

    "title": "Texas appeals ruling that Trump-urged voting map is racial gerrymandering",
    "text": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has quickly appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling that the redistricting passed by lawmakers at the urging of President Trump was based on racial gerrymandering. \"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\" A three-judge panel had earlier Tuesday placed a temporary block on the map that Republican lawmakers passed this summer and ordered the state to use the district maps from the last two elections. The map that was overruled had been drawn to give Republicans an advantage in flipping as many as five House seats held by Democrats.  \"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,\" wrote the majority from a three-judge panel. The panel <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2025/10/01/532335/the-texas-gerrymandering-trial-begins-how-we-got-here/\" target=\"_blank\">heard a trial</a> <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/elections/2025/09/29/532061/federal-court-to-hear-case-challenging-texas-new-congressional-map-on-wednesday/\" target=\"_blank\">on the case</a> in October. The plaintiffs included several civil rights groups and individuals. The ruling is a blow to Trump and the Republicans in a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5599558/states-redistricting-house-2026-midterm-elections\" target=\"_blank\">nationwide redistricting race</a> that <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2025/07/09/526083/congressional-redistricting-including-in-houston-on-texas-governors-agenda-for-special-legislative-session/\" target=\"_blank\">began in Texas</a> this summer. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, also said he would appeal the ruling on the \"Big Beautiful Map\" which he called \"entirely legal\" in a statement. Democrats praised the court ruling. \"Race was always a driving factor and a driving factor to make it harder for minority Texans,\" said Texas Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher in an interview. \"This map was drawn to make it harder for them to have an impact in elections.\" The court's decision, in a 2-1 ruling, comes at a pivotal moment. Around the country, Trump is pressing Republican state lawmakers to reshape congressional voting maps to hold the party's slim majority in the House and support his agenda. Using their heavy Republican majority in the legislature, Texas lawmakers passed a map in August designed to help their party grow its ranks in the 2026 elections for the U.S. House. The process gained national attention when Democrats in the legislature <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2025/08/02/527799/congressional-redistricting-map-passes-house-committee-pushing-dems-towards-quorum-break/\" target=\"_blank\">fled the state for over</a> two weeks to delay a vote and Republican leaders threatened to arrest them. Democrats argued the new map weakened the voting power of Latino and Black communities. The redistricting in Texas also prompted California Democrats to act. This month <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5587742/election-results-california-proposition-50-redistricting\" target=\"_blank\">California voters passed</a> an initiative allowing redistricting that could help Democrats win five seats in that state. <h3 id=\"Was\" it partisan gerrymandering or racial gerrymandering? >Was it partisan gerrymandering or racial gerrymandering? </h3> Republicans in the Texas Legislature <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/texas/2025/08/20/529098/texas-house-passes-congressional-redistricting-map-amid-protests-following-dem-quorum-break/\" target=\"_blank\">passed the map saying</a> it was designed to improve their party's chances of winning five congressional seats. They noted that, unlike in some states, the law in Texas does not prohibit redistricting for partisan advantage and that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts could not intervene when it's done. But partisan gerrymandering can often overlap with racial gerrymandering, which is illegal. Opponents of the map argued in court <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-10-06/texas-map-congressional-redistrict-trump-democrat-republican\" target=\"_blank\">that it intentionally diminished</a> the voting power of minority communities.  The 160-page opinion was written by District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was appointed by Trump during his first term as president. His ruling drew upon statements and contradictions in what Republican lawmakers said as the maps were passed. A letter the Department of Justice wrote to encourage the redistricting ended up being grounds the court used to block the effort. The judges noted that when Gov. Abbott originally called lawmakers into session to draw the map, <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/elections/2025/09/29/532061/federal-court-to-hear-case-challenging-texas-new-congressional-map-on-wednesday/\" target=\"_blank\">he cited a letter from Justice Department </a>officials criticizing districts that had majority nonwhite voting populations as \"racial gerrymanders.\" In other words, the letter implied the districts as they stood gave non-white voters an advantage and that had to be reversed. Eventually, Texas Republicans said the map was not intended to correct for a racial tilt but for partisan gain. That letter put lawmakers, who for years had denied their use of race when making maps, in \"a difficult spot,\" according to University of Texas at Austin political scientist Josh Blank, because they were \"ultimately saying opposite things.\" Brown's ruling criticized the construction of the letter itself, which was sent by Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"It's challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,\" Brown wrote. \"This decision is a rebuke of Donald Trump and to some degree a rebuke of lawmakers in Texas,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist with the University of Houston. \"They think the process was flawed and the Department of Justice was not credible in their legal arguments.\" Rep. Gene Wu, Democratic leader in the Texas House, said Tuesday's ruling shows the courts still hold true to American principles. \"The striking down of the maps is fundamentally a sign that the courts still believe in the core principles of this country: That one man, one vote idea is something that is absolute and must be kept up,\" Wu said. Around the country, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5599558/states-redistricting-house-2026-midterm-elections\" target=\"_blank\">Republicans have more options for redistricting</a> seats their way than Democrats do, in part because the GOP controls more state legislatures. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade after the national census. At the behest of Trump, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina passed new maps that could help the GOP win a seat in each state. Ohio drew a map that analysts say gives Republicans a slight advantage in a few seats. For Democrats, in addition to the five seats that could be gained in California, a court-ordered redistricting in Utah could help Democrats win a seat there. And Virginia Democrats have started a process that could yield two seats in that state. <hr /> <a href=\"https://www.kut.org/people/blaise-gainey\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blaise Gainey</em></a><em> covers state politics for The Texas Newsroom. </em><a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/staff/andrew-schneider/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Andrew Schneider</em></a><em> covers politics and government for Houston Public Media.</em> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/348773786/larry-kaplow\"target=\"_blank\"   ><em>Larry Kaplow</em></a><em> with NPR contributed to this story.</em>",

    "text": "Former child actresses, as well as teenage girls around the country, have posted photos of themselves at 15 years old after journalist Megyn Kelly seemed to downplay the youth of Jeffrey Epstein's victims on her podcast. In a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-T5Hp2WldFk?si=vsWemU2SuDKqeHLz&t=1903\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> with NewsNation host Batya Ungar-Sargon on \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" on Nov. 12, Kelly stated that she knows \"somebody very close to this case\" who \"told me from the start [...] that Jeffrey Epstein, in this person's view, was not a pedophile.\" \"He was into the barely legal type, like, he liked 15-year-old girls,\" Kelly continued. \"I'm not trying to make an excuse for this, I'm just giving you facts — that he wasn't into, like, 8-year-olds. But he liked the very young teen types that could pass for even younger than they were, but would look legal to a passer-by.\" The age of consent in the United States ranges from 16 to 18 years old, depending on the state. It is not legal for an adult to engage in sexual activity with a girl below 16 years old in any U.S. state. NPR has reached out to Megyn Kelly for comment. NPR will update this story if we receive a response from Kelly. <strong>Women and girls react to Kelly online</strong> Many on social media were prompted to insist that 15 year olds are children. Actress and activist Cynthia Nixon weighed in on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRIJ-WGEimc/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>: \"Megyn Kelly, I have a question for you, from one mother to another,\" she said. \"If Jeffrey Epstein were still alive, would you be comfortable with your teenage daughter being alone with him in his mansion? [...] And please, don't say 15 is barely legal. It is 100% illegal, and you know that.\" She was joined by celebrities who were former child actors, like Christina Ricci. On her Instagram story, Ricci posted, \"This woman is a danger to children.\" That Instagram story has since expired and is no longer online. Valerie Bertinelli, who starred in the sitcom <em>One Day at a Time,</em> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRFHlGtADfv/\" target=\"_blank\">shared</a> a picture of herself at 15, with the caption: \"This picture was taken in 1975. I'm 15. I'm a child. I'm gonna say this a little louder for those in the back row. I'm FIFTEEN. I'M A CHILD.\" She ended with a call to action, encouraging others to \"flood the Internet with pictures of all of us at 15.\" The Hollywood actresses were joined by actual teenagers, including a girl who posted a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cheeringforchange/video/7572724531001888013?_r=1&_t=ZP-91VjS1Ibpvi\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok video</a> from an account called @cheeringforchange and said her name is Eloise and that she is 14 years old. She said she wanted to respond to Kelly's comments with a \"reality check from a literal child.\" \"The minute adults start defending predators by debating the age of a child, you're not protecting the truth. You're protecting the predator. And you shouldn't need a freshman to tell you that.\" <strong>Survivors advocating for the release of the Epstein files</strong> Some of Epstein's survivors who are now adults but say they were 17 or younger when they were abused have taken leading roles in pressuring both President Trump and Congress to release the full Department of Justice files on Epstein. On Tuesday, eight of them posted a \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEz_Yoa1QCE\" target=\"_blank\">national PSA</a>,\" which called for the release of all of the Epstein files. This was done in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.worldwithoutexploitation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">World Without Exploitation</a>, a national coalition of organizations working to end human trafficking. After showing photos of the women at ages 14 to 17, the video ends with a call for justice: \"It's time to bring the secrets out of the shadows. It's time to shine a light into the darkness.\" On World Without Exploitation's website, it urges Americans to call on members of Congress to vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act: \"By mandating the release of these files—while safeguarding the privacy of survivors—the legislation seeks to shed light on the enablers, co-conspirators, and institutional protections that allowed Epstein's operation to flourish. It aims to close loopholes that obstruct justice and ensure that no one, regardless of wealth or power, is above the law.\" The response to Kelly's comments preceded the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/nx-s1-5611438/epstein-files-bill-house-vote\" target=\"_blank\">nearly unanimous vote in the House of Representatives</a> to publicly release the full slate of the Department of Justice files on Epstein's child sex trafficking.

    "text": "The U.S. deported 50 people to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/1082539802/russia-ukraine-invasion-explained\">Ukraine</a> this week, a Ukrainian border official said on Tuesday, in what appears to be the single largest such deportation from the U.S. since the country has been at war with Russia. The flight landed near the Polish border in the early hours on Monday. Since Russia's invasion in 2022, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported 105 Ukrainians in total, with 13 in the last quarter of 2024, according to the latest data available in<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/statistics\" target=\"_blank\">ICE's publicly available tracker</a>. The Trump administration originally wanted to send 80 people on the flight, according to Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States. That original list also included at least one person that Ukraine had previously been unable to claim as a citizen of the country. It wasn't immediately clear why only 50 people out of the group of 80 ended up in Ukraine. Immigration lawyers have raised concerns that those deported to Ukraine could be conscripted to fight in the war. All men in Ukraine from ages 25 to 60 are eligible to be drafted, though <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5591158/ukraine-russia-war-women-ukrainian-military\" target=\"_blank\">some women</a> and younger people have also volunteered. While U.S. law permits deportations, including to countries that people are not originally from, domestic and international laws prohibit deportations to place where someone may face violence, persecution or torture. The Trump administration has brokered deals with countries with notorious human rights records or who are facing conflict, including with South Sudan, Libya, Eswatini, Rwanda and El Salvador, to receive deportees from the United States, as it seeks to ramp up mass deportations. Six of the 8 men deported to South Sudan over the summer are still there, according to their lawyers, while the Associated Press reported that those sent to the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/nation/3-deported-by-u-s-held-in-african-prison-despite-completing-sentences-lawyers-say\" target=\"_blank\">other countries have been imprisoned there</a>. \"Currently, border guards have ensured their registration in the border relation for entry into Ukraine in accordance with the rules established by law,\" Andrii Demchenko, spokesman for Ukraine's State Border Service, told NPR. \"It is worth noting that Ukraine accepts its citizens in any case.\" The spokesperson said Ukraine would accept any of its own citizens who had been deported from the U.S. The embassy did not answer questions regarding what would happen to people deported to the country. \"It should be noted that deportation is a widely used legal mechanism provided for by the immigration laws of most countries around the world,\" Stefanishyna said in a statement provided to NPR. \"It is a routine procedure applied to all foreign nationals and stateless persons who violate the terms of their stay in the United States, regardless of their nationality.\" <h3>One migrant first profiled by NPR fought immediate deportation</h3> Eric Lee, an immigration lawyer with a client on the flight, said the detainees include people who have lived in the U.S. since they were children. \"Many have U.S. citizen spouses and children. Some do not even speak Ukrainian, and others are not even Ukrainian citizens, having been born in the Soviet Union before Ukraine existed as a separate country,\" Lee said in an interview. One of Lee's clients, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/19/g-s1-94019/ice-immigration-detention-due-process\">Roman Surovtsev</a>, was recently transferred through several detention centers in Texas in preparation for the deportation to Ukraine, even as his attorneys continue to fight his removal in court. According to Justice Department court filings, the administration had intended to put him on the flight. NPR confirmed he ended up not being deported after an immigration court stayed his deportation hours before the flight, while his case was reopened in immigration court. Surovtsev, who lived in Dallas with his U.S. citizen wife and two children, was born in the Soviet Union. He came to the U.S. as a refugee, but lost his green card when he was a teenager when he pleaded guilty to a carjacking in California. As NPR has previously reported, the U.S. previously tried and failed to deport Surovtsev to Ukraine, which was unable to provide the necessary travel documents for deportation. For years, Surovtsev completed yearly check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement until he was detained during his visit in August. ICE then tried to give him deportation documents, but those papers were in Ukrainian, a language he does not speak. His team of lawyers was able to vacate his conviction and move forward with reinstating his green card. Still, Surovtsev has remained in detention. U.S. District Judge Ada Brown, who was appointed by President Trump, originally blocked Surovtsev's removal earlier this month through Jan. 13 but reversed her decision a few days later, surprising Surovtsev's attorneys. \"He is likely to receive his green card once again very soon. And he has also not been given the opportunity to express his fear of being deported to an active war zone,\" Lee said. A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that Surovtesev has already received due process. \"He received full due process and was ordered removed by an immigration judge on November 4, 2014 — over a decade ago,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.\"<br>",

    "title": "Judge sides with Meta in antitrust trial, will not spin off WhatsApp and Instagram",
    "text": "A federal judge on Tuesday handed Meta a victory, ruling against the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in an antitrust suit that claimed the social media giant stifled competition and bolstered a monopoly by buying upstart rivals. The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/01/11/1072169787/judge-allows-federal-trade-commissions-latest-suit-against-facebook-to-move-forw\" target=\"_blank\"><u>FTC sued Meta five years</u></a> ago alleging anti-competitive behavior in what has amounted to the biggest legal challenge yet to one of the world's most influential social media companies. The case followed an investigation that began during the first Trump administration. Experts say it is part of a series of cases brought by the government to try to rein in \"big tech\" on antitrust grounds, targeting Meta, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/02/nx-s1-5478625/google-chrome-doj-antitrust-ruling\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Google</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5551026/amazon-prime-lawsuit-ftc-settlement\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Amazon</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5119948/a-look-at-the-dojs-lawsuit-against-apple-for-violating-antitrust-laws\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Apple</u></a>. The FTC's suit contended that Facebook, which later became Meta, overpaid to acquire Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 as part of a \"buy or bury\" strategy to eliminate competitors and protect what it alleged is a monopoly in social networking. The FTC argued that the only way to resolve Meta's alleged monopoly power was for the company to be broken up. In legal filings, government lawyers said a judge should order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp into separate companies, to give rivals more room to compete and users more choices. In a memorandum opinion, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote that the FTC had not demonstrated that Meta holds a monopoly in social media. Notably, he wrote that the world of what was once called \"personal social networking\" has changed — giving rise to new competitors and seeing YouTube become a more dominant force. \"Believing that the only constant in the world was change, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus posited that no man can ever step into the same river twice. In the online world of social media, the current runs fast, too,\" Boasberg wrote. \"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.\" He noted that two court opinions on motions to dismiss \"did not even mention the word 'TikTok'. Today, that app holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\" FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson said in a statement emailed to NPR that the agency was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision and he questioned Boasberg's impartiality. \"The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg,\" he said. Republicans have been unhappy with Boasberg, who has presided over deportation-related <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/g-s1-54493/judge-boasberg-trump-deportation-flights\" target=\"_blank\"><u>cases</u></a> and issued <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/g-s1-60696/judge-contempt-alien-enemies-act\" target=\"_blank\"><u>rulings</u></a> that the Trump administration has opposed. Trump has <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114183576937425149\" target=\"_blank\"><u>referred to him</u></a> as a \"Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge\" and called for his impeachment, which several conservative members of Congress are pursuing. In an emailed statement to NPR, Meta's Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Newstead welcomed Boasberg's decision in the antitrust case. \"The Court's decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition. Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" Newstead wrote. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/14/nx-s1-5358436/meta-ftc-antitrust-trial-opening-arguments\" target=\"_blank\"><u>During the trial</u></a>, which ended in May, Meta's lawyers argued that the company faces ample competition and that it bought Instagram and WhatsApp because they were good products. Its attorneys argued that federal authorities were attempting to punish the company for its success, noting that regulators approved both takeovers at the time. In court, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5364789/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ftc-antitrust-trial\" target=\"_blank\"><u>was peppered</u></a> with questions about his motives for pursuing the acquisitions. Asked about Instagram, he told the court he was impressed with Instagram's product and decided it was better to buy the app than invest in building one in-house. Bill Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University's law school and former chairman of the FTC, said the outcome was a decisive victory for Meta. He noted that it comes on the heels of a remedy <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/02/nx-s1-5478625/google-chrome-doj-antitrust-ruling\" target=\"_blank\"><u>ruling</u></a> in the Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google. Although a federal judge ruled that Google <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5064624/google-justice-department-antitrust-search\" target=\"_blank\"><u>held a monopoly in internet search</u></a>, Kovacic said, some observers saw the punishment as soft after the judge declined to force Google to sell its Chrome browser. Antitrust lawsuits may not be helpful ways to put guardrails around big, fast-moving tech companies, Kovacic said. \"Those two data points might suggest to you this is the wrong methodology.\"  He said there may now be renewed debate about the need for fresh regulations to keep tech companies in line when it comes to competitive behavior as well as things like user safety and security.  \"We see an interesting alliance on the left and the right hand side of the political spectrum in Congress, saying that big tech does present a serious question about control, behavior and oversight,\" he said. \"There seems to be a coalition that's willing to take some measures, although finding common cause about a specific program seems to have been elusive.\" Legal watchers had previously noted that Zuckerberg and Meta had made efforts during Trump's second term to thaw his notoriously frosty relationship with the president — and speculated that it might prompt Trump to push the FTC to settle the suit. Trump had sued Meta after his social media accounts were suspended in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. This January, Meta paid <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5279570/meta-trump-settlement-facebook-instagram-suspensions\" target=\"_blank\"><u>$25 million to settle</u></a> that lawsuit. The same month, Meta also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/07/nx-s1-5251151/meta-fact-checking-mark-zuckerberg-trump\" target=\"_blank\"><u>ended its fact-checking program</u></a>, which some conservative critics had alleged was biased and a form of censorship. Meta <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/13/nx-s1-5227874/trump-bezos-zuckerberg-amazon-facebook-open-ai-meta-inauguration-fund\" target=\"_blank\"><u>donated $1 million</u></a> to the president's inauguration fund. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/mark-zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-ftc-negotiations-a53b3382\" target=\"_blank\"><u>reported</u></a> in April that Zuckerberg's efforts to settle with the FTC were rebuffed. It is unclear if the government will appeal. The FTC's Simonson said the commission was \"reviewing all our options.",

According to two people who were briefed on the plan by the Trump administration, and who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, the administration has forged six new agreements between the Education Department and other agencies, offloading day-to-day operations of congressionally-required programs while retaining a small contingent of staff at the department. For example, under these new agreements, much of the work of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, which includes managing Title I, a key federal funding stream that helps schools support low-income students, would shift to the U.S. Department of Labor, as would much of the work of the Office of Postsecondary Education. The U.S. Department of the Interior would take on much of the work of the department's Office of Indian Education. The U.S. Department of State would take on international education and foreign language studies programming. Responsibility for the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) program, which <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/24/772018032/vital-federal-program-to-help-parents-in-college-is-a-drop-in-the-bucket\" target=\"_blank\">offers childcare on college campuses</a> to low-income student-parents, would move to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/11/16/school-funding-trump-dismantle-education-department/87251723007/\" target=\"_blank\">USA Today op-ed</a> published Sunday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon wrote of this kind of agreement: \"We'll peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage programs and empowering states and local leaders to oversee the rest. These partnerships are commonplace across the federal government to improve service delivery and increase efficiency.\" In July, the Education Department announced one such agreement with the Labor Department, in which Labor took on responsibility for adult education and family literacy programs previously administered by the Education Department, though an <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-and-us-department-of-labor-implement-workforce-development-partnership\" target=\"_blank\">Education Department release</a> insisted, \"The programs will be managed alongside [Education Department] staff, with continued leadership and oversight by [the Education Department].\" Tuesday's agreements do not include a handful of the department's signature responsibilities, including special education, student civil rights enforcement and student loans. In a Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-announces-six-new-agency-partnerships-break-federal-bureaucracy\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>, McMahon said, \"The Trump Administration is taking bold action to break up the federal education bureaucracy and return education to the states.\" Opponents of the administration's move say, given that Congress created these offices and explicitly located them inside the Education Department, the White House cannot legally move their work without Congress' approval. U.S. Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a senior member of the Senate education committee, said in a statement, \"This is an outright illegal effort to continue dismantling the Department of Education, and it is students and families who will suffer the consequences as key programs that help students learn to read or that strengthen ties between schools and families are spun off to agencies with little to no relevant expertise and are gravely weakened—or even completely broken—in the process.\" In briefing lawmakers and staff, the department insisted that these programs' statutory responsibilities would remain at the department, even if the work would be done elsewhere.  It's unclear if retaining a modicum of department staff, in partnership with other agencies, will be enough to convince the courts the administration is following federal law. According to NPR's two sources, the briefing was led by Lindsey Burke, now deputy chief of staff for policy and programs at the department, who also co-authored the education section of the conservative government blueprint, Project 2025, outlining how to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. \"The federal Department of Education should be eliminated. When power is exercised, it should empower students and families, not government,\" <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Burke wrote</a>. There will likely be legal challenges opposing Tuesday's moves.<br>",

    "text": "President Trump defended Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when questioned in the Oval Office Tuesday about CIA findings that the prince approved the killing of <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Jamal Khashoggi. \"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\" Trump said, referring to Khashoggi. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it. And would you leave it at that? You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question.\" The CIA <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/02/25/971215788/biden-administration-poised-to-release-report-on-killing-of-jamal-khashoggi\" target=\"_blank\">concluded the crown prince approved the 2018 operation</a> that killed and dismembered Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey, but Salman maintained he had no knowledge of the attack, which he's called \"heinous\" and \"unjustifiable.\" On Tuesday, he said that his country has \"improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this doesn't happen again.\" Trump also dismissed questions about a conflict of interest regarding his family's business ties to Saudi Arabia while hosting Salman as president. He said that he has \"nothing to do\" with the family business and added that while he helped build a successful business, he \"decided to leave that success behind and make America very successful.\" The two men touted a deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that would bring hundreds of billions in investment into the United States in exchange for access to key military and technology assets for the Gulf nation. After a trip to Saudi Arabia in May, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-600-billion-investment-commitment-in-saudi-arabia/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the White House announced </u></a>the Middle Eastern country had made a $600 billion \"commitment to invest in the United States.\" During the meeting inside the Oval Office on Tuesday, Salman said Saudi Arabia is going to invest more than that. \"We are going to increase that $600 billion to almost $1 trillion of investment — real investment and real opportunity,\" Salman said about deals related to technology, including artificial intelligence. It's unclear if that meant Saudi Arabia plans to invest $1 trillion directly or if Salman believes the investment will grow to be worth that much. The crown prince has expressed that Saudi Arabia has particular interest in AI. On defense, Trump and Salman reiterated plans for the U.S. to sell F-35s to Saudi Arabia. But Trump said he doesn't think Israel will be concerned about the deal. In fact, he believes the exact opposite, stating \"they're going to be very happy.\" Trump also said he could see a formal civil nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia happening eventually but \"it's not urgent.\" When it came to the Abraham Accords, a set of agreements that established diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states that Saudi Arabia is currently not a part of, Salman didn't directly say whether or not the country would join. Salman said he believes having relations in the region is \"a good thing, and we want to be part of the core, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path of two-state solution,\" referring to Palestinian statehood. Salman said they had a \"healthy discussion\" with President Trump on the topic and that \"we're going to work on that to be sure that we can prepare the right situation as soon as possible to have that.\" Trump added a conversation on a two-state solution would be discussed further as well. Salman's trip to the White House isn't over just yet. A dinner is planned this evening at the White House following today's meetings.",

    "text": "When both your parents are in show business, you get used to being stopped on the street. Just ask <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/08/683192524/ben-stiller-unlocks-an-old-fashioned-prison-break-in-escape-at-dannemora\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Stiller</a>, whose parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, formed a hit comedy duo in the 1960s and '70s.  \"My mom usually wouldn't want to talk to people for a long time ... and my dad would talk to people forever,\" Stiller says. \"As kids ... you feel that your parent's attention [is] being taken away from you.\" <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/05/24/409322369/long-time-actress-and-comedian-anne-meara-dies\" target=\"_blank\">Meara died in 2015</a> and her husband <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/11/698175656/comedian-jerry-stiller-who-played-hot-headed-dad-on-seinfeld-dies-at-92\" target=\"_blank\">followed in 2020</a>. After his father's death, Ben Stiller found a stash of audio recordings his dad had made of his conversations and arguments with Meara about their marriage and their act. Those tapes are at the center of Stiller's new documentary about his parents, <em>Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost.</em>  Stiller says his father was always more committed to comedy than his mother, who studied under <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2004/01/15/1600212/actress-uta-hagen-dies-at-84\" target=\"_blank\">Uta Hagen</a> and dreamed of being a serious actor. They had been married for several years, both struggling to make it in show business, when Jerry Stiller had the idea to create short comedy sketches together. \"He drew her into doing this comedy act,\" his son says. \"And that changed their lives.\" The comedy team of Stiller and Meara would go on to appear on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em> more than 30 times. Later, Jerry Stiller co-starred on <em>Seinfeld</em>, playing Frank Costanza, George's father. Meanwhile, Ben Stiller was forging his own path in Hollywood, both as an actor and a filmmaker.  Stiller is currently the executive producer and director of the TV series, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5333849/severance-finale-review\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Severance</em></a>, about a company that makes its employees get a procedure on their brain that separates the memories of their home life and the memories of their work life. The premise is almost the direct opposite of the lifestyle his parents modeled while he was growing up.  \"Their marriage, their relationship ... was also what their act was about,\" Stiller says. \"So I think that concept of the separation is actually really very interesting to me because it's something I've never had.\" <hr /> <h3><strong>Interview highlights</strong></h3> <strong>On Jerry Stiller's desire to be loved by everyone</strong> I think I can identify. ... I think most actors have a certain sense of wanting approval. ... He'd talk about it very openly. He said, \"I need that love from the audience.\" It's kind of armchair psychology, but ... he didn't get a lot of nurturing from [his parents] when he was a kid. ... They fought a lot, and they were very poor, and nobody was encouraging him to go into show business. ... He went to Syracuse University and he performed in plays and he found his people and found this warmth and acceptance in the theater, and he was always connecting with people. I think he loved talking to people. He loved when fans would come up and say hi to him. And it meant something to him, and my mother had a very different relationship with it. <strong>On the fun part of having celebrity parents</strong> I remember when they played nightclubs in New York and that was really exciting for us. We get to stay up late, hang out with the grownups. Interesting, funny people coming in and out of the house. They would have these New Year's Eve parties at their apartment in the late '70s and the '80s that were just amazing. ... As kids, it was really fun to be around. I loved going on sets when they would go out to LA. … To be on the Paramount studios lot ... made me want to make movies. Being around that, it was very clear early on that that's what I wanted to do. It was a lot of fun times and more interesting to my sister and I than school, for sure. <strong>On sneaking out while his parents traveled for work</strong> Our nanny, Hazel, took care of us basically since I think the time that I was probably about 4 years old. She was from Jamaica and she had seven kids of her own and they lived in Brooklyn and we became very close with her family, with her kids, because some of them were Amy and my age. My parents would go away for, like, a two-week stint to LA to do whichever game show or <em>Love Boat</em> or whatever it was. Hazel was so sweet. She knew she had to be the disciplinarian and keep us in line, but ... it was kind of like a free-for-all a little bit when we were on our own. We'd stay up late sometimes, trying to sneak out.  As we got older and became teenagers, then there were other things going on, like my sister started going to Studio 54 when I think she was, like, 17 and I was 13. And she would take me to Studio 54 with her friends and they would sneak us in. They put me in a yellow and green polka-dotted Fiorucci shirt ... and an Army jacket and these Mickey Mouse sunglasses. And they put this outfit on me and we went up and [the bouncer] Mark saw us and he pointed to us and said, \"Come on in.\" And we were in. And that happened a few times. So I think I was 13. <strong>On calling his dad when he had a bad LSD trip</strong> I took LSD once when my parents were out doing <em>The Love Boat</em> once. … I was the guy who called his parents on LSD. I called them up in LA because I was scared. I was having a bad trip and [it was] the only time I ever did LSD. My mom got really mad at me. And my dad was actually much nicer and kind of tried to help talk me down. And he said, \"I understand what you're going through. When I was 11 years old, I smoked a Pall Mall cigarette and I was sick for two days.\" And I was like, \"No dad, you don't understand. I don't understand what reality is.\" But he was great. He was actually great about it. <strong>On his father being cast as Frank Costanza on <em>Seinfeld</em></strong> It was life-changing for him. He was a very lovable guy and ... people just loved seeing him let out all this emotion and kind of this tamped up rage that he had inside in a very funny way. And I think the fame that it brought in, because <em>Seinfeld </em>was such a phenomenon, was like nothing he had ever experienced before. It was fulfilling for him, I think, a childhood dream of being someone who could be funny on his own. …  For me, I was kind of just starting to experience success on my own. So I was happy that my dad was working and that he was in this show that was such a phenomenon. There was never competition between us. … My mom was the one who sort of was, I think, having to deal with not having that kind of success at that point. But for her, I don't think it was as important a thing and as relevant to her own personal happiness, though I think she would have liked to have worked more as an actor. <em>Ann Marie Baldonado and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

    "text": "Alas, dear penny, you served us well. We picked you up, you gave us luck. We gave you to others in exchange for their thoughts. And remember when we pondered whether dropping you from the Empire State Building could kill a pedestrian? That was fun. (More on that later.) Now <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5407493/no-more-pennies-one-cent-treasury-stop-minting\" target=\"_blank\">you are dead</a> — but not gone (more on that later, too) — at the wizened age of 232. When polished, you look as young as when you were first minted, but you are worth less to us now, and we've moved on to greater expenses. The nation once used you to pay Union soldiers in the Civil War; now, you barely buy a gumball (and only in bulk!). Like nearly all Americans, you descended from an immigrant, the British penny. Those coins were once so valuable that they were split into halves and even quarters — your late British cousins, the halfpenny and the farthing. In Britain, the coin's history goes back to the time when kings and queens had <a href=\"https://stephenliddell.co.uk/2018/04/12/a-brief-history-of-the-penny/\" target=\"_blank\">names like <em>Offa</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Cynethryth </em>and <em>Aethelred the Unready</em>, and your name likely traces its lineage from the <a href=\"https://stephenliddell.co.uk/2018/04/12/a-brief-history-of-the-penny/\" target=\"_blank\">German for pan</a> — <em>pfanne</em>, for pan, which evolved to <em>pfennig</em>, for penny. The first one-cent coin in the United States rolled off a private mint in 1787 and wasn't called a penny. It was the fugio cent — fugio for \"fly away\" in Latin, <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/object/001-dollar-fugio-cent-1787%3Anmah_1096631\" target=\"_blank\">signifying time flies</a>. The 100% copper coin was inscribed with the surprising words, \"mind your business,\" more a take on \"penny wise, pound foolish\" than an admonition against nosiness. The U.S. minted its first<strong> </strong>official penny in 1793. Abraham Lincoln was pictured on the coin starting in 1909, to honor the centennial of his birth, the first time a president's image graced U.S. currency. The words \"In God We Trust\" were added at the same time. Ever the trailblazer, you, the humble penny, were the first to carry those words before Congress added it to all currency and made it the <a href=\"https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1951-2000/The-legislation-placing-In-God-We-Trust-on-national-currency/\" target=\"_blank\">national motto</a> almost a half-century later. Now, at just 2.5% copper and the rest zinc, you can't even beat the cost of your own production, according to the U.S. Mint, which says it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5407493/no-more-pennies-one-cent-treasury-stop-minting\" target=\"_blank\">took 3.69</a> of you to make only one more in 2024. Although we shall not meet any new pennies, we know you will hang around for another 30 years or so, because that's the typical <a href=\"https://kids.usmint.gov/coins-life\" target=\"_blank\">lifespan of a coin</a>, according to the U.S. Treasury. So, luckily for us, we'll still have the perfect coins to put in our penny loafers in the 2050s, when we can expect them to cycle back in style. (In the 1930s, young people put <a href=\"https://blog.schuh.co.uk/story/the-history-of-penny-loafers/\" target=\"_blank\">money in their shoes</a> for emergency pay phone calls, and thus the <a href=\"https://www.ghbass.com/pages/whats-a-weejun\" target=\"_blank\">Weejun was born</a>. Maybe someone will design a stylish cellphone shoe before the penny disappears?) Meanwhile, you live on in other ways. We will most certainly celebrate you aphoristically, and this is where the penny drops. We will always be in for a penny, in for a pound. We will proudly trade pennies for thoughts while continuing to give our own two cents' worth. We will still pinch you, because a penny saved is, as ever, a penny earned. We will put a shiny penny in a bride's shoe for luck. James Geary, author of <em>The World in a Phrase: A Brief History of the Aphorism</em>, says the penny is the perfect coin for<strong> </strong>these little pearls of wisdom. \"The penny lends itself to aphorisms because they are both small — the aphorism is the shortest form of literature, and the penny is the smallest monetary denomination,\" Geary says. Yes, you are small but mighty. Yet we will never kill anything with you, from the Empire State or any other tall building. Your dimensions — three-quarters of an inch thick and weighing less than a tenth of an ounce — are better <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/15/what-would-happen-if-you-were-hit-penny-falling-skyscraper/99160982/\" target=\"_blank\">suited to flipping and fluttering in the air</a> than reaching fatal velocity. As the Mythbusters demonstrated, the penny-drop myth <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-hAQUxm4No\" target=\"_blank\">isn't worth a dime</a>. But, at 10 cents, the dime is at least profitable to mint. Along with the dime, your survivors include the nickel and the quarter. Rest well, sweet penny.",

    "title": "Trump administration rule could further penalize immigrants for using benefits",
    "text": "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services wants to expand a Biden-era policy known as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/07/31/897429845/twin-rulings-by-federal-judge-block-public-charge-rules-for-immigrants\" target=\"_blank\"><u>public charge</u></a> that could further curtail immigrants' use of public benefits. That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card. Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation <a href=\"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-20278.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this week</u></a> that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use. \"Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,\" the proposal states. Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them. \"This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,\" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. \"By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.\" <h3>Politics of social safety net programs</h3> The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5560987/shutdown-undocumented-immigrants-medicaid-obamacare\" target=\"_blank\"><u>making false statements</u></a> of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs. People without legal status do not have access to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5595920/snap-usda-rollins-fraud\" target=\"_blank\"><u>SNAP</u></a>, the healthcare <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5560987/shutdown-undocumented-immigrants-medicaid-obamacare\" target=\"_blank\"><u>marketplace, Medicaid</u></a> and other public benefits. Still, Congress recently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/03/g-s1-75609/big-beautiful-bill-ice-funding-immigration\" target=\"_blank\"><u>applied further restrictions</u></a> stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status. The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications. U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs. <h3>Executive order targeted benefits</h3> In February, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/20/g-s1-49863/trump-executive-order-immigration-benefits\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Trump issued an executive order</u></a> to end \"all taxpayer-funded benefits for <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ending-taxpayer-subsidization-of-open-borders/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>illegal aliens</u></a>.\" Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea. Only about <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5389952/usda-snap-doge-data-immigration\" target=\"_blank\"><u>1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP</u></a> were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program. Trump in his first term had <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/12/748328652/trump-administration-rule-would-penalize-immigrants-for-using-benefits\" target=\"_blank\"><u>expanded the scope of benefits</u></a> that could count as a \"public charge\" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status. Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=public+charge+chilling+effect+npr&rlz=1C1GCFQ_enUS1132US1132&oq=public+charge+chilling+effect+npr&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORigATIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRigAdIBCDU0MDhqMGo0qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\"><u>chilling effect</u></a> on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-agriculture/2021/01/19/food-workers-stuck-in-vaccine-limbo-792828\" target=\"_blank\"><u>COVID-19 pandemic</u></a>, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so. In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision. It meant that using benefits such as the SNAP, housing aid or transportation vouchers would not count against green card applicants.<br>",

    "text": "<em>Here &amp; Now</em>&#8216;s Elissa Nadworny talks with <strong>Yomi Young</strong>, a friend of <a href=\"https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2017/05/11/dvp-interview-yomi-wrong-and-alice-wong-2/\">disability activist and author Alice Wong</a>, who died Friday at age 51 in California. Young tells us about Wong&#8217;s legacy of building community. <h3>Full interview transcript</h3> Elissa Nadworny:  Friends and loved ones are remembering disability activist and author Alice Wong. She died last Friday in San Francisco. She was 51. A MacArthur Genius Award winner, Wong was the founder of the Disability Visibility Project. The effort started out as a partnership with the nonprofit Story Corps to collect the oral histories of people with disabilities. The group grew into an online community. In 2016, Wong joined our show to talk about raising the profile of disability issues in the presidential campaign. <strong>(Soundbite of Alice Wong on <em>Here &amp; Now</em>:  You know, people with disabilities are seen as this kinda vulnerable, you know, ‘Oh, we can&#8217;t bully them. We, you know, we’ve got to protect them.’ And I feel like there&#8217;s also another aspect that, you know, people with disabilities can speak for themselves, can defend themselves. We just need to kind of listen to them.)</strong> Nadworny:  We just need to listen to them. Now let&#8217;s listen to disability and social justice organizer, Yomi Young. She was a friend of Alice Wong. Yomi, welcome back to <em>Here &amp; Now</em>. <strong>Yomi Young: Thank you for having me.</strong> Nadworny:  So Alice Wong brought her advocacy to the nation&#8217;s capital. She served on the National Council on Disability from 2013 to 2015. What current issues was she most passionate about that she would want you to draw attention to? <strong>Young:  Alice&#8217;s magic was in her ability to skillfully use technology and social media to build community and challenge structural oppression. And I would say most recently, she spoke a lot about her terror of losing Medicare benefits, which is a fear that millions of sick and chronically ill people are dealing with right now.</strong> <strong>And also, Alice called the situation in Gaza a disability justice issue and organized to raise millions to help Palestinians maintain digital connection to the rest of the world. She spoke up for Palestinians, and some people were not happy about that, and there were people who challenged her voice, that maybe her Genius Grant should be rescinded. And Alice stood firm, and she was unflinching, and she would not back down.</strong> <strong>But what was lovely about that is, you know, Alice never talked about that when she was with her friends. Alice was known by friends and those of us in the Bay Area for throwing really elegant parties, like super elegant.</strong> <strong>Alice lived in a really beautiful apartment in San Francisco. She was able to move out of her family home and live independently for the first time, for the last couple of years, and she really flourished socially during that period. I might have lost track of your question, but I think this is what&#8217;s going to be missed.</strong> Nadworny: That’s OK. I mean, at the end of the day, she was your friend. I mean, this is what you’ll remember about her. <strong>Young:  Absolutely. And this is what I will miss. It&#8217;s not, you know, Alice the luminary, Alice the MacArthur Genius, whatever that means. We kind of teased about that.</strong> <strong>But it&#8217;s Alice, the gorgeous, generous friend. It&#8217;s the signature red Chanel lip. It is her bougieness. It is her tenderness. It is the way that she practiced care. It&#8217;s, you know, the brownies that she brought to my house a few weeks ago so that we could decorate pumpkins with my daughter. It is the unexpected packages you would receive from Alice. And, it&#8217;s not just me.</strong> <strong>People all over the country in the world whom Alice connected with, some whom she&#8217;d never met, would receive an Alice Wong care package. It&#8217;s just the generosity of spirit, of the exchange of ideas.</strong> <strong>Alice was my peer, and it feels like many of our generation with disabilities are not seeing old age, and it&#8217;s a lonely feeling, and it&#8217;s scary. And it&#8217;s also, for me, it&#8217;s precious, you know, holding onto these relationships, and just having had this friendship with Alice. To live in the time of Alice Wong and to have experienced her camaraderie, her trust, her care, and her friendship was truly amazing.</strong> Nadworny: How can we honor Alice going forward? <strong>Young:  I think we can honor Alice by speaking truth to power, and I would say just keep pushing.</strong> <strong>You know, Alice wrote her own death announcement, and the kicker to that death announcement was, ‘Don&#8217;t let the bastards grind you down.’ I think I&#8217;m quoting that correctly. And I would say, ‘Don&#8217;t let them grind you down.’</strong> Nadworny:  Yomi Young is a disability and social justice organizer helping us remember activist and author Alice Wong, who died last week. Yomi, thank you so much for sharing with us. <strong>Young: Thank you so much for remembering Alice.</strong> ____ <em><a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/ashley-bailey\">Ashley Locke</a> produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/mark-navin\">Mark Navin</a>. <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/grace-griffin\">Grace Griffin</a> produced it for the web.</em> This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/11/18/alice-wong-obituary\">WBUR.org.</a><img src=\"https://pixel.wbur.org/1054535\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;\" />",

    "title": "Why voting to release Epstein files is 'emotional' for Rep. Nancy Mace",
    "text": "The House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to force the Department of Justice to release all of its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail in 2019. Thousands of documents were already released last week. Some mention President Trump, among other prominent figures, but the White House says he did nothing wrong. <em> Here &amp; Now</em>&#8216;s Jane Clayson spoke with South Carolina Republican <a href=\"http://mace.house.gov/\">Rep. Nancy Mace </a>ahead of the vote, which she has long pushed for. &#8220;I see this as a very symbolic day, and it’s a very emotional day for me because of the fight that this symbolizes, not just for [survivors of Epstein&#8217;s abuse] but for so many of us that&#8217;ll never get justice,&#8221; Mace said. <h3>6 questions with Rep. Nancy Mace</h3> <strong>What questions do you hope these documents answer? </strong> &#8220;I want to thank the Epstein victims, every single woman who had the courage to come forward. &#8220;I personally know the toll that this takes on someone’s life. But they are a vessel not just for the justice they’re seeking for themselves, but they’re a vessel for the justice that millions of other women across the country are also seeking because most of us never get this day, most of us never get the opportunity to face our accuser let alone see them prosecuted or see them put in jail or in prison.&#8221; <strong>Did you feel pressure from Republican leadership or the president not to support it?</strong> &#8220;I share the President’s frustration with this entire thing being used as a political wedge. And why didn’t we do this four years ago? Why wasn&#8217;t this so important that we weren&#8217;t fighting like hell on the steps of the Capitol four years ago to have this happen? &#8220;I don’t ever want to see rape politicized. As a survivor of domestic assault, of sexual assault, to me it’s deeply, deeply frustrating. This needs to be about the victims and the women. &#8220;I get that out of 20,000 emails, his name is mentioned in a handful of them, and I believe in reference to Epstein trying to get retribution because Trump is the one that spoke to the authorities and kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago and all those things. But, you know, Epstein victims have exonerated him. &#8220;When women come forward, we’re attacked, we’re defamed, we’re smeared. I’m literally living this nightmare in real time with a man who abused me and he can just put something in a court document, the press runs with it because he’s a man and he’s attacking a conservative woman, it’s the truth, and so I have to hire attorneys, which I&#8217;ve done. &#8220;I have to go to law enforcement again, you know, and pursue criminal charges or pursue civil litigation, which is at a huge cost to me and my kids personally and professionally, but that’s what victims go through. And that’s what these women have gone through and so for me, I’m so grateful for the fight that they’ve stood up and said, &#8216;No more&#8217; and I’m here for it. I’m here for them.&#8221; <strong>President Trump has asked the Justice Department to investigate top Democrats who were connected to Epstein. Are you concerned that a new investigation could be used as a pretext to stop the documents from being released? Do you think these documents will actually be released?</strong> &#8220;I pray that they do. And if they don&#8217;t, then there are other methods that we can use that I have successfully used on the floor of the House, for example, to get some of this information out there. I don&#8217;t care if you have an R or a D by your name.&#8221; <strong>President Trump has the power to ask the Justice Department to release the files without a vote. Do you have any idea why that hasn&#8217;t happened?</strong> &#8220;I know that he has in the past said that he wanted all the grand jury files released. We’ve also released files through the [House] Oversight Committee. I can’t speak for the President and I’m sure weighing those options is something his team will do internally. I’m an all of the above. Let’s get it all out.&#8221; <strong>Is today&#8217;s vote a sign that Republicans are willing to break from Trump?</strong> &#8220;Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican party. He’s a wonderful leader. &#8220;Two weeks ago, I had to call the president because a young woman was desperately trying to get brain surgery that her insurance company provider declined. Donald Trump got that done in a few hours. &#8220;I then had to call the White House staff the very next day because I had a young woman, a constituent, who was stuck in a Bosnian prison over a minor passport issue. &#8220;Again, the president stepped up to the plate to help this young woman. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t ask what her political affiliation was, nothing. &#8220;I have witnessed him personally do so much for women in this country that I’m proud of his work and I’m proud to support him too. As a survivor, he’s been nothing but respectful of me and when I’ve gone to him, ‘Hey this young woman needs help,’ he’s been there for them.&#8221; <strong>What&#8217;s your message to the Epstein survivors who are at the Capitol on Tuesday?</strong> &#8220;I’m meeting with some of those survivors today. I want them to know, it’s an emotional day, for me, and that their fight is my fight. &#8220;And the vote tonight is not just a vote for them but it’s a vote for every woman who’s been traumatized by abuse and it’s a huge day in the country, not just for them, but for every one of us who want justice — we’re getting it tonight.&#8221; <em>This interview was lightly edited for clarity. </em> <em><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> </em><em>In this interview, Rep.

    "title": "Milli Vanilli used to be Grammys poison… but not anymore",
    "text": "If you were asked to name the three lowest moments in the history of the Grammy Awards, you ... might have a tough time narrowing down a proper list. You might note the year the Grammys introduced a heavy metal category, rightfully nominated <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15730259/metallica\" target=\"_blank\">Metallica</a> and then gave the award to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/90721971/jethro-tull\" target=\"_blank\">Jethro Tull</a>. Or the year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/166258260/macklemore-ryan-lewis\" target=\"_blank\">Macklemore</a> swept <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/166009689/kendrick-lamar\" target=\"_blank\">Kendrick Lamar</a> in the hip-hop categories, prompting an outcry from pretty much everyone, including Macklemore himself. Or the year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/95782521/tracy-chapman\" target=\"_blank\">Tracy Chapman</a>'s \"Fast Car\" lost record of the year to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15405153/bobby-mcferrin\" target=\"_blank\">Bobby McFerrin</a>'s \"Don't Worry, Be Happy,\" or … okay, let's move on. Grammy history is festooned with inexplicable snubs, embarrassments, blind spots and moments in which classics were passed over in favor of flashes in the pan. Still, the Grammys have never absorbed a greater embarrassment than they experienced when news broke that the public-facing members of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1000880616/milli-vanilli\" target=\"_blank\">Milli Vanilli</a> — winner of the Grammy for best new artist at the beginning of 1990 — didn't sing their own songs. Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan, the photogenic performers who'd been the faces of Milli Vanilli, were actually lip-syncing the frothy pop songs that had made them famous. It was a significant scandal in the fall of 1990 — though, as is the case with so many scandals, the folks who experienced the most public shaming (Pilatus, Morvan, the Recording Academy) didn't exactly align with those most directly responsible (if you're looking for someone to blame, consider producer Frank Farian, or perhaps <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI5IA8assfk\" target=\"_blank\">the rain</a>). Milli Vanilli's Grammy was revoked and that was that. The incident didn't just make the Grammys look bad, or throw kindling on the roaring rhetorical fire of those lamenting the fabricated nature of so much pop music. It also compelled them to be more cautious about honoring genres and subgenres widely viewed as lightweight. In the decades since, the Grammys have been slow to embrace boy bands, K-pop acts and other artists who face a credibility gap among Grammy voters, whose 21st century preferences have tended more toward legacy acts (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15231985/steely-dan\" target=\"_blank\">Steely Dan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15294441/herbie-hancock\" target=\"_blank\">Herbie Hancock</a>), flamboyant showmen (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/208638149/jon-batiste\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Batiste</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/166969902/bruno-mars\" target=\"_blank\">Bruno Mars</a>), jazzy pop sophisticates (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15012277/norah-jones\" target=\"_blank\">Norah Jones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1120541975/samara-joy\" target=\"_blank\">Samara Joy</a>) and contemporary rock stars (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15333650/beck\" target=\"_blank\">Beck</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/17000138/foo-fighters\" target=\"_blank\">Foo Fighters</a>). When <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/531040090/harry-styles\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Styles</a> won album of the year in 2023 and said, \"This doesn't happen to people like me very often,\" he got <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellendurney/harry-styles-backlash-over-grammys-album-of-the-year-speech\" target=\"_blank\">roasted for it</a> on social media. But people like Styles — not \"rich young good-looking white men\" so much as \"singers who came up in boy bands like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/149157994/one-direction\" target=\"_blank\">One Direction</a>\" — actually <em>have</em> often struggled to win Grammys, and are generally expected to pass through a sort of authenticity gauntlet (or at least demonstrate pop-cultural staying power) before getting accepted into the club. The Grammys have even tweaked their own eligibility requirements for the category of best new artist — it used to be far more stringent about newness than it is now — in part to allow acts more time to prove themselves. Why does that unofficial authenticity gauntlet exist? At least one of the answers is that <em>Milli Vanilli won best new artist in 1990</em>. As much as the Grammys are known for making embarrassing mistakes — you know it's true — they're also known for overcorrecting in the years that follow. Metallica lost that metal Grammy for <em>…And Justice for All</em> in 1989, only to win an award for \"One\" (a song from the same record!) the following year, and then \"Stone Cold Crazy\" the year after that, and then the black album the year after that. Kendrick Lamar got shut out in that fateful Year of Macklemore (2014), only to win 22 Grammys and counting in the years since — including two in 2015 and five in 2016. After years of frustration in the general categories, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/19230778/beyonce\" target=\"_blank\">Beyoncé</a>'s <em>Cowboy Carter </em>finally <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/g-s1-46200/grammys-2025-10-takeaways-beyonce-kendrick-lamar-chappell-roan\" target=\"_blank\">won album of the year</a> in 2025, after decades of taking home awards primarily in genre-specific categories like R&B and pop. The Grammys, for all their faults, do try to right their old wrongs. But the initial beneficiaries of their mistakes aren't always so lucky. Macklemore has never sniffed a Grammy nomination in the years since beating Lamar. In the case of Jethro Tull, that 1989 win corresponded with the veteran band's first — and, at least as of this writing, last — nomination. Milli Vanilli's post-Grammy story has proven more complicated — and tragic. Pilatus and Morvan attempted a comeback as actual singers, released an ill-fated album as Rob & Fab in 1993 and even prepared a follow-up. But that record was shelved upon Pilatus' death in 1998. Morvan, however, has kept working — as a musician, a DJ and an author. Earlier this year, he released his memoir, <em>You Know It's True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli</em>, which was accompanied by an audiobook read by Morvan himself. On Nov. 7, 35 years after the Grammys forgot his number, Morvan was nominated in the category of best audio book, narration and storytelling recording. His competition includes Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and the Dalai Lama, who, had they thought ahead, really should have lip-synced each other's books, just to be rascals. It's a twist few saw coming: a redemption story for a guy who helped bend the arc of Grammy history.<br>",

But what do actual self-identified witches think of <em>Wicked? </em>It's a tale that gives a sympathetic spin to the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West, a character who terrified generations of children, in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. \"Oh my God, I love <em>Wicked</em>!\" announced Tiffany Walker, who owns a metaphysical boutique called Moonlit Mystic in Wayne, Mich., where she also organizes an annual occult-themed block party called <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/witches-be-witchin-2025-tickets-1320425451069\" target=\"_blank\">Witches Be Witchin'</a>. \"I would consider myself an eclectic witch,\" she said, explaining that people today who call themselves witches draw from a number of folk traditions and ancient beliefs. \"I would also consider myself an eclectic witch,\" added her friend, who calls herself Mama Rainbow. She instructs followers in the art of performing <em>limpias</em>, a Mexican spiritual cleansing ritual, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/AMeaningfulDream\" target=\"_blank\">on her YouTube channel</a>. \"I love how they humanized Elphaba and Galinda to show that witches are just regular people,\" Mama Rainbow said. She was wearing a white dress and bright rainbow-colored jewelry. \"I think we've been taught that a witch is not normal, but I think we all are.\" Walker added that she appreciates how <em>Wicked</em> gives the main character a name — Elphaba — and some dignity. \"She's no longer scary or something to fear,\" Walker said. \"She's really this misunderstood hero.\" A hoodoo practitioner and initiated Oshun priestess who calls herself Juju Bae is also a fan. \"This witch loves <em>Wicked</em>,\" she said on a Zoom call from Brooklyn. \" I am obsessed with <em>Wicked</em> I love it. I cannot wait until the second half comes out!\" Still, Bae worries a little about how<em> Wicked</em> has helped move the secret and spiritual art of witchcraft into the mainstream. That's been happening for years, at least since the rise of 1990s movies like <em>The Craft</em>, <em>Practical Magic </em>and <em>Hocus Pocus</em>, according to the 2021 book <em>Lights, Camera, Witchcraft: A Critical History of Witches in American Film and Television</em>. Witchcraft has become a little gentrified since then, says Bae.

Bae says she hates to think that the success of <em>Wicked</em>, which started with Gregory Maguire's popular novel in the 1990s, has contributed to what she calls overcommercialization and overconsumption of witchcraft. But it is impossible for most witches not to cheer for Elphaba, says Heather Greene, a self-identified \"modern witch\" and author of <em>Lights, Camera, Witchcraft</em>. \"Elphaba redeems the figure of the wicked witch in a way that is very satisfying to practicing witches,\" she said. \"And she's just an icon of the witch, so generally speaking, the witchcraft community adores her.\" So expect lots of singing — and cackling — along during <em>Wicked: For Good, </em>which opens this weekend<em>.</em>",

    "title": "40 years ago, Calvin and Hobbes' raucous adventures burst onto the comics page",
    "text": "40 years ago — on November 18, 1985 — a new comic strip appeared in the newspaper: <em>Calvin and Hobbes.</em> Hobbes was a stuffed tiger, but in the mind of 6-year-old Calvin he was a wryly observant companion for his day-to-day challenges and wildly imaginative adventures. Adventures of the beloved duo lasted just a decade. Their creator — cartoonist Bill Watterson — walked away from <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> at the height of its popularity.  Watterson — who has given few interviews — seamlessly combined the silly, the fantastic and the profound in his strip. That slightly demented quality captured editor Lee Salem, who spoke with NPR's Renee Montagne in 2005. <em>The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.</em> <hr /> <h3>Interview highlights</h3> <strong>Lee Salem:</strong> I remember it when I first read it, and it all... it literally took my breath away. And I circulated it in the office, and the response was immediate. It was fresh, it was funny, the art was strong, and here's this archetypal little boy living a life that some of us lived or wanted to live or remembered living. ...  One of the single favorites that I have is actually on my wall in the office, and it shows Calvin in bed, obviously with a fever or something. He's got a thermometer in his mouth. You hear the words from a television. He's watching a soap opera — you know, \"If you leave your spouse and I'll leave mine and we can get married.\" And it goes on and on and on, as lurid soap operas sometimes do. And Calvin turns to the reader with a big grin on his face, and he says, \"Sometimes, I learn more when I stay home from school than when I go.\" And I just thought that was so funny. And, amazingly, when it ran, we actually got complaints from readers who said, \"Well, you know, you're advocating that children stay home and watch adult soap operas.\" And somehow, the whole sense of irony was lost in that, but I don't think it was lost on me. I love that strip. <strong>Renee Montagne:</strong> You know, I describe him as a little boy with his tiger friend, but there's so much more to it than that. So there's one where they're sitting philosophizing, as they often do, on the grass, this time under a tree. Hobbes is looking at the sky and saying, \"Do you think there's a god?\" And they're both gazing and thinking, and then in the fourth panel, Calvin thinks about it. And then do you remember what he says? <strong>Salem:</strong> Yeah. \"Yeah, well, someone is out to get me.\" <strong>Montagne:</strong> Calvin was preceded into existence by some pretty famous little boys: Charlie Brown, Dennis the Menace. What made him different? <strong>Salem:</strong> You know, we saw Calvin living in a world he never made, populated by adults and teachers, and he was trying to deal with that and accomplish what he could. I think Calvin has a bit more perhaps Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in him than Charlie Brown. Hobbes I see almost as the alter ego of Calvin. He's a balancing act that allows Calvin to exist. He provides commentary on some of Calvin's crazy adventures and attitudes. <strong>Montagne:</strong> Hobbes goes from being a stuffed tiger when there's any other person in the room, to the real Hobbes we know and love. Is Hobbes real or not? <strong>Salem:</strong> He is to me, and obviously he is to Calvin. Whether he is to the other characters or not is an open question. But I think one of the things Bill brought to the art board was this wonderful ability to take a child's imagination and fantasy life and make it real. It really is irrelevant whether Hobbes has an existence as we would define it. For Calvin, he is there. He's a buddy, he's a companion, he's a friend. <em>Lee Salem edited </em>Calvin and Hobbes<em> until the comic strip ended in 1995. Creator Bill Watterson said at the time that he wanted to explore a canvas beyond the four panels of a daily newspaper, and to work at what he called \"a more thoughtful pace,\" but has produced little public work since then.</em> <em>Salem died in 2019.</em>",

    "title": "A 'breakthrough' drug to prevent HIV, an 'unprecedented' rollout",
    "text": "Five months after a \"breakthrough\" HIV prevention drug got approval in the United States and became available in many wealthy countries, it's getting rolled out in two African countries hit especially hard by the disease. On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department announced that Eswatini and Zambia have each received 500 doses of lenacapavir, a drug manufactured by Gilead Sciences that's been hailed as by <em>Science </em>as a \"<a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024\" target=\"_blank\"><u>breakthrough</u></a>.\" Just two injections a year provide near-complete protection against an HIV infection. \"This is somewhat unprecedented, to see an innovation in global health move this fast to low- and middle-income countries,\" says Mitchell Warren, the executive director of AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC), a global HIV prevention organization. \"Obviously very small supplies, really just a down payment, but they're the first of what we think to be many doses in these two countries and in other countries.\" The delivered doses mark the first small step toward providing at least 2 million doses to the highest burden countries, largely in Africa, by 2028. That's the goal of the Global Fund, a major donor to combating HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, along with Gilead Sciences and the State Department. But the breakthrough drug arrives \"just as we've seen some of the most dramatic political and economic challenges in the AIDS response,\" says Warren. In addition to likely increasing the overall HIV burden because of disrupted care, Warren says the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts have damaged some of the very systems and programs best positioned to deliver lenacapavir to the people most in need of protection. \"We are starting from a deficit that we didn't have to, that was a making entirely of the U.S. government's own.\" <h3><strong>Rapid delivery</strong></h3> The State Department <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5527019/hiv-prevention-drug-breakthrough-aids\" target=\"_blank\"><u>announced its investment</u></a> in lenacapavir in September, pledging to provide up to 2 million doses by 2028. \"We think we're going to hit that target sometime in mid- to early 2027 [and] we're going to be procuring more than half a million doses collectively next year,\" said Jeremy Lewin, a senior official for Foreign Assistance, Humanitarian Affairs and Religious Freedom at the State Department, at a press briefing this week. The 500 doses are being provided by Gilead at cost, with no profit going to the company, according to CEO Daniel O'Day. The company plans to cover up to 2 million doses total before licensed generic manufacturers get up and running, but it's not clear how many doses they currently have on hand. \"We do have supply to send to markets when they have the appropriate regulatory approval, and replenishment for Eswatini and Zambia,\" he said in the briefing. Since FDA gave lenacapavir <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5527019/hiv-prevention-drug-breakthrough-aids\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the thumbs up</u></a> in June (followed by <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2025-who-recommends-injectable-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention\" target=\"_blank\"><u>World Health Organization</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-injection-easier-prevention-hiv-infection-eu-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\"><u>European Medicines Agency</u></a> in July), Gilead has been applying for regulatory approvals across sub-Saharan Africa. So far, Zambia and South Africa have approved the drug (Lewin said the U.S. was not planning to fund doses of lenacapavir to South Africa, which would be encouraged \"to fund doses for their own population.\" Eswatini's ministry of health issued a separate import authorization, their version of approval. Where will the drug go next? The company has filed for approval in Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe, with more in the works, said O'Day. \"We continue to prioritize 18 high burden countries representing 70% of the HIV epidemic.\" Of course, delivery is only the first step. To curb the epidemic, doses, which are injected into the abdomen or thigh, have to get to the people who need them. Health ministries will be primarily responsible for that. But in many cases, governments have relied on community organizations and non-governmental organizations for help. Lewin, of the State Department, said that's part of the U.S. America First Global Health Strategy's effort to boost national government's \"self-reliance.\" Still, many health systems have relied on outside organizations that have been defunded or diminished by the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts, says Warren. That includes one his organization, AVAC, helped implement. The program was aimed at boosting health systems capacity to deliver injectable HIV drugs, like lenacapavir, which can be trickier to distribute than pills. It was frozen in January, he says, and hasn't gotten back up to full speed. \"If you don't have the program that meets people where they are, then those doses aren't going to get used,\" says Warren. \"There's a lot of history of global health products that everyone thinks are exciting, and then they sit in store rooms because we didn't build the program to deliver them.",

    "title": "This week in books: Get stuck in a Nov. 18 time loop, and explore the world in 70 maps",
    "text": "Few dates on the calendar get shorter shrift than poor old November 18. Bereft of major holidays, all but anonymous, and cold — but not even cold enough to snow (at least in a lot of the U.S.) — it makes a strong claim for the year's least notable day. So spare a bit of pity for Tara Selter. When readers first met the narrator of Danish author Solvej Balle's ongoing septology, <em>On the Calculation of Volume</em>, Tara was already on her 121st November 18 in a row. That number now stands well north of 1,100 (and counting) as the third installment of this mesmerizing time loop gets its English translation Tuesday. For better or worse, though, her condition isn't catching. Ordinary folks like us only get one swing at this half-digested hairball of a date each year, so we may as well seize the day. Better yet, with new books on the docket from Joy Williams, Simon Winchester and Tracy K. Smith, among other talented writers, we probably ought to stay inside reading until the 19th. <hr /> <strong><em>On the Calculation of Volume Book III</em>, by Solvej Balle, translated by Sophia Hersi Smith and Jennifer Russell</strong> While six of the novels in Balle's seven-volume project have been published so far in the original Danish, this is the third to be translated into English, with the fourth expected in the spring. Don't be misled by the author's modest self-description – <a href=\"https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/features/solvej-balle-and-barbara-j-haveland-interview-on-the-calculation-of-volume-I\" target=\"_blank\">\"just another time-loop story\"</a> – hers is an ambitious experiment nearly four decades in the making. \"It takes a familiar narrative trope – a protagonist inexplicably stuck in the same day – and transforms it into a profound meditation on love, connectedness and what it means to exist,\" said the judges who put Barbara Haveland's translation of the first volume on the shortlist for <a href=\"https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books/on-the-calculation-of-volume-i\" target=\"_blank\">this year's International Booker Prize</a>. <hr /> <strong><em>The Pelican Child: Stories</em>, by Joy Williams</strong> Williams is one of our most accomplished adepts in the art of estrangement — in literally making the mundane <em>strange</em>. The short stories in her latest collection are spiny little nuggets of jamais vu. Sure, they tend to bear the distinguishing characteristics of the familiar world, with all its stressed assistants and heiresses and bewildered man-children, but they're also moved by some alien inner logic that can be disquietingly difficult to discern. In Williams' hands, reality is a changeling with an occasionally wicked sense of humor. <hr /> <strong><em>Fear Less: Poetry in Perilous Times</em>, by Tracy K. Smith</strong> Speaking to NPR in 2017, Smith explained the human consolations of poetry in an era of disconnection and turmoil: It's \"a voice on a page that's saying, 'I have lived, I have felt, I have questions, and I have wishes.'\" More than eight years later, the former U.S. poet laureate, Pulitzer Prize winner and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/01/27/145985904/newspoet-tracy-k-smith-writes-the-day-in-verse\" target=\"_blank\">onetime NPR NewsPoet</a> is confronting today's tumultuous moment by listening closer than ever to that voice on the page. In these essays, composed partly of close readings and broad commentary on the possibilities of poetry itself, Smith again proves to be an able ambassador for an artform. <hr /> <strong><em>The Breath of the Gods: The History and Future of the Wind</em>, by Simon Winchester</strong> Winchester, a former reporter, can find a good story just about anywhere he looks, and the range of his gaze is simply enormous. From warzones and Wonderland, to precision engineers, natural disasters and not one but two books about the Oxford English Dictionary, the venerable storyteller has covered a lot of ground in the past half-century. This time, the noted subtitle enthusiast is taking to the air, literally, with a study of the phenomenon that shapes Earth's climate and influences human history. <hr /> <strong><em>Atlas of Borders: Walls, Migrations, and Conflict in 70 Maps</em>, by Delphine Papin, Bruno Tertrais, and Xemartin Laborde</strong> Imagine you're a visitor to Earth, trying to wrap your head around a world that now contains <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population\" target=\"_blank\">more than 8 billion people</a>. There would be worse ways to try to understand all its seething complexities than cracking open this multiform portrait of community, disorder and change. This trio of French thinkers – which boasts extensive experience in <a href=\"https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/experts/bruno-tertrais\" target=\"_blank\">geopolitical research</a>, design and cartography – has assembled some 200 illustrations that seek to make sense of everything from the war in Ukraine and the ramifications of Brexit, to curious maritime borders and vast global migrations, with plenty of fun (and not-so-fun) facts scattered throughout.",

    "text": "The Defense Department is scaling back the number of federalized National Guard troops in Chicago and Portland, Ore., as weekslong court battles have stalled their deployments. A defense official, not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed to NPR that 200 California National Guard members in Oregon and 200 Texas National Guard members in Illinois will return to their home states in the coming days. The troop withdrawals were first reported by <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-california-national-guard-members-leave-portland-chicago/story?id=127560214\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a>. On Friday night, the military's Northern Command hinted on <a href=\"https://x.com/USNorthernCmd/status/1989555770091037084?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\">X</a> that changes were to come in order to \"ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.\" \"Our troops in each city (and others) are trained and ready, and will be employed whenever needed to support law enforcement and keep our citizens safe,\" U.S. Northern Command added. The defense official told NPR that the holidays may have also played a role in the decision to withdraw out-of-state troops. About 300 Illinois National Guard personnel will remain activated in Chicago, while the number of Oregon National Guard forces in Portland will be reduced from 200 to 100, the defense official said. Over the past six months, President Trump has ramped up the use of the National Guard — justifying the move as necessary to address crime, handle protests or protect federal buildings and personnel. Local and state officials in Oregon and Illinois have condemned the troop deployments, calling them unnecessary and accusing the president of overstepping his authority. Courts have repeatedly blocked troops from conducting operations in the streets of Chicago and Portland after state and local leaders sued. On Nov. 7, a federal judge in Oregon <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/11/07/portland-oregon-national-guard-trump-politics-karin-immergut/\" target=\"_blank\">permanently blocked troop deployments</a> to Portland — which the Trump administration appealed on Friday, according to court records. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is considering an emergency appeal brought by the Trump administration to allow the president to deploy troops to Chicago.",

    "title": "The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier is in the Caribbean. Here's its backstory",
    "text": "The world's largest and most expensive aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/MEDIA/NEWS-ARTICLES/Article/4332637/gerald-r-ford-carrier-strike-group-enters-caribbean-sea/\" target=\"_blank\">announced Sunday</a> that the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group had made its way into the Caribbean Sea, with 4,000 sailors and \"dozens\" of military aircraft aboard the lead ship. The strike group's deployment comes as the Trump administration continues to increase the pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, who was charged by U.S. prosecutors in 2020 with narco-terrorism and other crimes. In August, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/nicolas-maduro-moros\" target=\"_blank\">upped the reward</a> for information leading to Maduro's arrest or conviction to $50 million. Meanwhile, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/15/nx-s1-5609888/aircraft-carrier-caribbean-venezuela-military-action\" target=\"_blank\">has recently carried out 20 strikes</a> on boats near the country that American officials say were smuggling drugs, though the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5584173/trump-drug-boats-venezuela-maduro\" target=\"_blank\">has yet to publicly provide any evidence</a> for those claims, and lawmakers and legal experts have indicated the strikes are likely illegal under U.S. and international law. Last week, Trump said \"I've sort of made up my mind\" on next steps for U.S. involvement in Venezuela, but he gave no further details, and other administration officials have shared little about what they are planning in the South American nation. Still, the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford signals continued escalation by the U.S. Here's what to know about the ship and its role in the Caribbean. <h3>The Ford only recently began operations</h3> The USS Gerald R. Ford is a relatively new addition to the Navy's fleet. The keel of the carrier was laid in 2009, a tradition marking the beginning of a new ship's construction, and the Ford was officially commissioned in 2017. It is named for the 38th U.S. President Gerald Ford, a Navy veteran who served on the USS Monterey light aircraft carrier during World War II. It wasn't until 2023 that the Ford left port on its first combat deployment, initially to participate in exercises with NATO allies. But the <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3648681/gerald-r-ford-carrier-strike-group-returns-from-historic-deployment/\" target=\"_blank\">carrier's deployment was extended</a> by more than two months after war broke out between Hamas and Israel, and the Ford was sent to the Mediterranean Sea to support Israel and prevent the conflict from escalating. <h3>The innovative ship's pricy construction was marred by delays</h3> The Ford is the inaugural ship of a new class of U.S. aircraft carriers that will replace the current Nimitz-class carriers, the first of which launched from a Newport News, Va., shipyard in 1972. Ford-class carriers <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3214857/navys-newest-aircraft-carrier-joins-allies-for-exercise-silent-wolverine/\" target=\"_blank\">possess 23 technological advancements</a> for aircraft carriers, according to the Navy, including a new electromagnetic system for launching aircraft that replaces steam-powered catapults. The Ford-class ships are also expected to be able to operate with a crew 20% smaller than that of a Nimitz-class carrier. But the military <a href=\"https://www.military.com/dodbuzz/2014/01/31/navy-alerted-to-ford-class-carrier-reliability-issues\" target=\"_blank\">struggled to implement some of that new technology</a> on the Ford, resulting in construction delays. The Navy says the tab for building the Ford, the most advanced U.S. aircraft carrier in existence, topped $13 billion. Bryan Clark, a former naval officer with the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1226791291\" target=\"_blank\">told NPR</a> last year that Nimitz-class carriers cost a little over half that. \"So in retrospect, that extra investment was probably not worth it,\" he said. The delivery of the next Ford-class aircraft carrier — which will be known as the USS John F. Kennedy — <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2025/07/07/carrier-john-f-kennedy-delivery-delayed-2-years-fleet-will-drop-to-10-carriers-for-1-year\" target=\"_blank\">was recently delayed</a> by two years and is now not expected until early 2027. <h3>The Ford's role in the Caribbean</h3> Last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that the U.S. would conduct Operation Southern Spear, a mission he said was to eliminate \"narco-terrorists\" and secure \"our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people.\" The massive build-up of American military might in the region, including the arrival of the Ford, is a part of that effort. Beyond the aircraft carrier itself, the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group contains nine carrier airwing squadrons, two Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers and an integrated air and missile defense command ship. The strike group's arrival adds to American military assets that had already been in the region, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and an embarked marine expeditionary unit. All told, there are now nearly a dozen Navy ships and roughly 12,000 sailors and Marines in the area, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/aircraft-carrier-venezuela-trump-ford-strikes-drugs-241ea9e039d717b9f80f793922cb7cc9\" target=\"_blank\">according to The Associated Press</a>.",

    "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., once one of President Trump's strongest supporters in Congress, called his foreign policies \"not America first positions\" and said his recent attacks against her can \"put my life in danger.\" Greene and Trump have traded barbs in last few days over the future of the Make America Great Again movement, raising new questions about the president's firm grip on the Republican Party.  On Friday, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115551127714537339\" target=\"_blank\">withdrew</a> his endorsement of the Georgia lawmaker calling her \"Wacky\" and claiming Greene's recent criticism of him was all about his refusal to support her future political ambitions. On Saturday, Trump called her a \"traitor\" in a social media <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115554138689247811\" target=\"_blank\">post.</a>    \"He called me a traitor and that is so extremely wrong,\" Greene said during an interview on CNN's <em>State of The Union</em> with Dana Bash on Sunday. \"And those were the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger.\" When asked about her previous attacks against political opponents — such as in 2020 when she posted an image of a gun alongside a group of progressive Democratic congresswomen — Greene apologized.  \"I think that's fair criticism,\" Greene said. \"And I would like to say humbly I'm sorry for taking part and the toxic politics. It's very bad for our country.\" During the extensive interview, Greene also criticized Trump's recent defense of the H-1B visa program — which lets companies sponsor foreign-born workers for skilled labor. During a Tuesday Fox News interview, Trump said the U.S. has \"to bring this talent\" and he said the country doesn't have enough of it.  \"Those are not America first positions,\" Greene said on Sunday before voicing displeasure at his frequent foreign trips. \"And continuing to really travel all over the world doesn't help Americans back at home. I really — and I said this to him and I will say it out loud — I would love to see Air Force One be parked and stay home.\" Despite her break with Trump, local GOP leadership in Georgia's 14th Congressional District are standing with Greene.  \"Recent national criticism directed at Congresswoman Greene does not change the fundamental truth that she serves at the direction of the people of this district,\" Chairman Jim Tully posted of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BfX9dLGN2/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook </a>Saturday. \"While the President of the United States represents the nation as a whole, Congresswoman Greene represents the people of Northwest Georgia, and she has done so with clarity, resolve, and integrity.\" This public rift between Greene and Trump marks a brewing fissure in the GOP. When asked what caused the break, Greene pointed to the battle over releasing documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  \"Unfortunately, it has all come down to the Epstein files, and that is shocking,\" Greene said.  The Georgia lawmaker said she doesn't believe Trump is implicated in these files. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the release of documents related to investigations of Epstein this week after enough members signed a discharge petition brought by Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.   On ABC News Sunday, Massie warned his fellow Republicans that voting against the release of the files would stain their long-term political futures — even if Trump attacks them in the short-term.   \"In 2030, he's not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles,\" Massie said. \"The record of this vote will last longer than Donald Trump's presidency.",

    "title": "Your artificial Christmas tree will cost more this year, thanks in part to tariffs",
    "text": "According to the <a href=\"https://www.christmastreeassociation.org/press-releases/survey-finds-artificial-christmas-trees-continue-to-dominate-us-holiday-dcor\" target=\"_blank\"><u>American Christmas Tree Association</u></a>, 83% of households who plan on displaying a Christmas tree in 2025 will choose an artificial one. But this year, not even holiday cheer is safe from economic tensions, as tariffs and supply chain pressures are pushing prices up. Mac Harman, founder and CEO of Balsam Hill, an artificial Christmas tree company, explains the increase will be noticeable. \"Whatever price point you might have been looking at last year, expect that to be about 10% to 15% more this year,\" he says. Nearly all artificial Christmas trees are imported from China. While Harman says that manufacturing costs remain steady, the price vendors pay to U.S. customs has increased, as a result of President Trump's ongoing tariffs on China. Trump often says his tariffs are intended to incentivize manufacturing on American soil. However, manufacturing domestically wouldn't be a simple switch for Harman and his team. \"The interesting thing about pre-lit artificial Christmas trees is they've never been made in the U.S.,\" Harman explains. Harman says it's a tedious process to attach the lights by hand like his company does – involving zip ties and painstaking attention to detail to ensure each bulb is perfectly placed – a task American workers rejected 30 years ago when prelit trees first hit the market. \"It's very unlikely that something almost like basket weaving is a trade that's going to move from a lower wage, lower cost of living country to the United States for the first time,\" Harman says. Other companies in the Christmas industry are facing the effects of tariffs too. Harman says many of his company's U.S. based suppliers, who purchase their component parts overseas, are also seeing higher costs too. \"The prices have gone up no matter if we make something here or if we make it in other places,\" he says. Harman has tried multiple strategies to keep Balsam Hill's prices competitive. Internally, he's made reductions to his workforce, paused hiring, and frozen raises. He's also diversified his supply chain, manufacturing trees in Mexico, Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. Last year, when President Trump won the election, Harman pre-ordered his supply for Christmas 2025, almost a year in advance. \"We shipped as many products as we could between November and January 20th, Inauguration Day, because there was a lot of discussion that there was going to be a day one tariff,\" Harman says. Each time the administration lowered tariff rates this year, Harman restocked his supply – an option he fears may not be available to him next holiday season. For shoppers, his advice is simple: don't procrastinate. Because of the price increases, some retailers ordered less stock, raising the risk of mid-December shortages. \"Look for a tree that you love, and if it's on some kind of sale, buy it,\" Harman says. In past festive seasons, shoppers might have delayed in the hope of getting a bargain, but that might not be such a good idea this time around. \"Seeing if you might get 10% off if you wait two weeks, I don't think that's going to work as well this year as it might in a normal year,\" Harman says.<br>",

    "title": "'We have no choice': Indigenous guards take on cocaine gangs in Peru's Amazon",
    "text": "UCAYALI, Peru — As they patrol their ancestral territory deep in the Amazon, some of the members of the Kakataibo Indigenous Guard carry spears. Others wield machetes. Several have traditional bows and arrows and one has an ancient shotgun slung over his shoulder. Threading their way along overgrown paths and wading through rivers, the mission of this tightly-knit group of Indigenous villagers is deadly serious — to find illicit plantations of coca, the key ingredient in cocaine, on tribal land. \"We don't want it here,\" says one, who asks to go unnamed for fear of reprisals from the drug traffickers. \"Coca just brings trouble. It means death, for us and the forest.\" Cultivation of the Andean crop is booming here in Peru — the world's second-largest producer of cocaine. An increasing amount is now being grown in the Peruvian Amazon. It's a vast and often lawless frontier zone, larger than Texas. The region is also home to some of the last Indigenous hunter-gatherers on Earth, who still live cut off from the outside world. The number of hectares of coca in the South American nation rose from <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/peruandecuador/en/noticias/2015/informe-de-monitoreo-2014.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 43,000 (106,255 acres) in 2013</a> to <a href=\"https://www.gob.pe/institucion/devida/noticias/1195330-peru-reduce-por-segundo-ano-consecutivo-los-cultivos-de-coca\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 90,000 (more than 222,000 acres) in 2024</a>. The country now produces an estimated 850 tons of cocaine a year, production fueled by the global demand for the drug, including in the world's largest consumer market, the United States. Here in the lowland region of Ucayali, there are an estimated 12,000 hectares (nearly 30,000 acres) of coca as well as dozens of clandestine landing strips, including on titled Indigenous land and even within reserves for some of those extremely vulnerable isolated tribes. With the coca comes corruption, deforestation and bloodshed. In recent years, around 20 Indigenous leaders have been murdered in Peru for opposing the drug traffickers and illegal loggers who frequently work hand in hand with them. Six of them were Kakataibo, a small ethnic group whose several thousand members are spread out across the central Peruvian Amazon. The jungle heat actually results in a weaker, lower quality product than coca grown in the mountains. But it is also easier to smuggle the cocaine over Peru's long jungle border with Brazil and Bolivia than transport it over the Andes to Peru's Pacific ports and main international airport in Lima. Dirandro, Peru's specialist counternarcotics police, are struggling to keep up. Eradicating crops is like playing whack-a-mole in this sprawling jungle territory. Dirandro Commander David Mori Trigoso says his men work valiantly in difficult circumstances as he shows a cocaine press, used to make 1 kilogram (2.2 pound) bricks of the hard drug, seized in a recent operation. \"We're always pursuing the narcos but they also keep evolving,\" he adds. Eventually, after nearly two hours of bushwhacking, the Indigenous Guard comes to a series of verdant cliffs rising spectacularly out of the rainforest. This remote spot is not just where the Andes meets the Amazon but also the start of a government reserve for the last Kakataibo families still living in what anthropologists call \"voluntary isolation.\" They prefer that term over \"uncontacted.\" These Indigenous communities have consciously chosen to retreat deeper into the jungle because of past traumatic encounters with outsiders — including disease, massacres and enslavement. The Indigenous Guard launch a drone and within three minutes it has geolocated two separate fields of coca inside the reserve. They will now report this to the authorities. One woman tells NPR that the Kakataibo inside the reserve, who may be her distant relatives, are terrified by the drug traffickers. \"They're in their habitat but they feel invaded,\" she says. \"So, we have to always protect them.\" The danger is all-too real. Segundo Pino, the leader of the Kakataibo Indigenous Guard, points out a recent death threat he has received on his cellphone. In misspelt Spanish brimming with epithets, it promises that Pino and other Kakataibo leaders are going to \"fall one by one\" and that \"blood will be spilled.\" \"How do we defend ourselves?\" Pino asks. \"We've lost faith in our authorities. That's why we've set up the Indigenous Guard. We must defend ourselves. We have no choice.",

    "text": "TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's foreign minister on Sunday said that Tehran is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country. Answering a question from an Associated Press journalist visiting Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered the most direct response yet from the Iranian government regarding its nuclear program following Israel and the United States' bombing its enrichment sites in June. \"There is no undeclared nuclear enrichment in Iran. All of our facilities are under the safeguards and monitoring\" of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Araghchi said. \"There is no enrichment right now because our facilities — our enrichment facilities — have been attacked.\" Asked what it would take for Iran to continue negotiations with the U.S. and others, Araghchi said that Iran's message on its nuclear program remains \"clear.\" \"Iran's right for enrichment, for peaceful use of nuclear technology, including enrichment, is undeniable,\" the foreign minister continued. \"We have this right and we continue to exercise that and we hope that the international community, including the United States, recognize our rights and understand that this is an inalienable right of Iran and we would never give up our rights.\" Iran's government issued a three-day visa for the AP reporter to attend a summit alongside other journalists from major British outlets and other media. Iran's Institute for Political and International Studies, affiliated with the country's Foreign Ministry, hosted the summit. Titled \"International Law Under Assault: Aggression and Self-Defense,\" the conference included papers by Iranian political analysts offering Tehran's view of the 12-day war in June, many seizing on comments from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz praising Israel for having done the \"dirty work\" in launching its attack. \"Iran's defensive response was remarkable, inspiring, historic and above all, pure,\" wrote Mohammad Kazem Sajjadpour, an international relations professor. \"How can one possibly compare Israel's dirty deeds to the noble and clean actions of the Iranian nation?\" Images of children killed by Israel during the war lined the walkway outside the summit, held inside the Martyr General Qassem Soleimani Building, named for the Revolutionary Guard expeditionary leader killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2020. But Iran finds itself in a difficult moment after the war. Israel decimated the country's air defense systems, potentially leaving the door open to further airstrikes as tensions remain high over Tehran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, economic pressures and societal change continues to challenge Iran's Shiite theocracy, which so far has held off on making decisions on whether to enforce its mandatory hijab laws or raise the price of government-subsidized gasoline, both of which have sparked nationwide protests in the past.",

    "title": "Hundreds of thousands rally in Manila against flood-control corruption scandal",
    "text": "MANILA, Philippines  — Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos gathered Sunday in the capital in the largest rally so far to demand accountability for a flood-control corruption scandal that has implicated powerful members of Congress and top government officials. Various groups have protested in recent months following the discovery that thousands of flood defense projects across one of the world's most typhoon-prone countries were substandard, incomplete or simply did not exist. Government engineers, public works officials and construction company executives have testified under oath in hearings by the Senate and a fact-finding commission that members of Congress and officials at the Department of Public Works and Highways took kickbacks from construction companies to help them win lucrative contracts and avoid accountability. Most denied the allegations. Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said about 320,000 members of the Iglesia Ni Cristo, or Church of Christ, led the start of the three-day rally in Manila's Rizal Park, many wearing white and carrying anti-corruption placards. Hundreds, including retired generals, held a separate anti-corruption protest late Sunday at the \"People Power\" monument in suburban Quezon city. Iglesia is an influential group that votes as a bloc and is courted by political candidates during elections. The police, backed by the military, went on full alert and deployed thousands of personnel to secure the weekend rallies, although the government expects them to be peaceful, according to a confidential security assessment seen by The Associated Press. During a Sept. 21 anti-corruption demonstration, a few hundred black-clad protesters threw rocks, bottles and firebombs at police near the presidential palace in Manila, injuring more than 100 officers. Criminal complaints have been filed against 97 protesters. The presidential palace went on security lockdown over the weekend, with major access roads barricaded by anti-riot police, cargo containers and barbed wires. National police chief Lt. Gen. Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. ordered law enforcement to exercise \"maximum tolerance\" in Sunday's rallies. <h3></h3><h3>Marcos promises quick action as outrage over corruption grows</h3> Flood control is an especially sensitive issue in the Philippines, one of Asian countries most prone to deadly typhoons, flooding and extreme weather. Two typhoons left at least 259 dead this month, mostly from flash floods and landslides, and affected millions of others. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been trying to quell public outrage and street protests sparked by the scandal, saying on Thursday that many of the powerful senators, members of Congress and wealthy businesspeople who were implicated would be in jail by Christmas. Marcos said an independent fact-finding commission he created has already filed criminal complaints for graft and corruption and plunder against 37 suspects. Criminal complaints have also been filed against 86 construction company executives and nine government officials for allegedly evading nearly 9 billion pesos ($152 million) in taxes. Among those accused are lawmakers opposed to and allied with Marcos, including former House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president's cousin and a key ally; and former Senate President Chiz Escudero. Both have denied any wrongdoing. Sen. Bong Go, a key ally of former President Rodrigo Duterte, has also been accused of involvement in corruption in flood control and other infrastructure projects. He has denied the allegations. Duterte, a harsh Marcos critic, was detained by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands in March for alleged crimes against humanity over his brutal anti-drugs crackdowns. His daughter, the current vice president, said Marcos should also be held accountable and jailed for approving the 2025 national budget, which appropriated billions for flood control projects. There have been isolated calls, including by some pro-Duterte supporters, for the military to withdraw support from Marcos, but Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. has repeatedly rejected those calls. \"With full conviction, I assure the public that the armed forces will not engage in any action that violates the Constitution,\" Brawner said. \"Not today, not tomorrow and certainly not under my watch.",

    "title": "An Iraqi vet navigates war and coming home — and his bond with an NPR reporter",
    "text": "The first I saw of Dave Carlson was his back, in a prison jumpsuit on Sept. 3, 2015. Carlson had been calling me from the cellblock payphone for a few weeks for an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/11/05/454292031/behind-bars-vets-with-ptsd-face-a-new-war-zone-with-little-support\" target=\"_blank\">NPR story</a> about incarcerated combat veterans and PTSD. \"Jail is the least therapeutic atmosphere you could probably ever imagine,\" Carlson had told me over a scratchy phone line. \"You come in one way and you leave three times worse.\" Now I finally got a look at him, while the judge decided if Carlson could walk free — or stay locked up for up to six more years. He was 31, and the only Black man I remember seeing in that courtroom in Waukesha, Wis. Nearly done with a four-year sentence for robberies and drug offenses, he was facing additional charges for crimes he'd committed inside prison. Carlson served two combat tours in Iraq, and none of his military buddies could make sense of how he'd wound up sitting in the dock. \"When it came to how to lead and how to represent yourself, David was definitely on the list of people that I held in an iconic standpoint,\" National Guard Sgt. David Rock told me that day. They had met in 2007 on Carlson's second deployment. Three other Iraq buddies filled a back row in the courtroom, along with Carlson's family. Their stories of his strengths and virtues, and Carlson's thoughtful interviews on the phone from jail just didn't square with the long rap sheet the judge was reading off: felony operating under the influence, felony bail jumping, battery by prisoner while incarcerated. \"So the maximum exposure here is 12 years today with six years of confinement,\" Judge Donald Hassin concluded. Hassin himself had served as well, in Vietnam, but it wasn't clear whether that was going to help or hurt Carlson's case. \" Mr. Carlson, this criminal justice system, frankly, has bent over backwards and gone through a lot of hoops in an effort to maintain you in the community. And frankly, sir, the response to all that has not been good,\" the judge said. I was there in Waukesha to cover Carlson's sentencing as part of my first-ever domestic job as a reporter after covering wars in South America, Africa and then Afghanistan and Iraq for 15 years. I'd pitched NPR on a beat following vets and the Department of Veterans Affairs as a new generation navigated the return to civilian life. But I'd had personal reasons too: I wasn't sure how to make a meaningful life back home after the urgency and all-consuming lifestyle of war reporting. Many veterans had the same question as I did: How do you get over war? Covering Dave Carlson's story would help provide an answer — but it would play out over 10 years of conversations, of dark difficult times and moments of remarkable triumph. <h3>Mentorship and moral injury</h3> Carlson grew up rough, around violence, drugs and prostitution in Minneapolis. \"My dad was a crackhead and a pimp,\" Carlson said \"Nothing but violence, guns, like all kinds of stuff like that, drug dealing.\" To impress his older brothers — his role models — Carlson had done a string of crimes. At 15 he'd been sentenced to juvenile detention and lived there until his grandparents adopted him and moved him up to Rice Lake, Wis. Things turned around for a while. Carlson did well at school and sports and won a college scholarship. But on his own in college, drinking became a problem and he felt himself slipping. The military offered a way out, but the Army wouldn't take him because of his juvenile record. \"It was the National Guard recruiter who was the one that was willing to do the extra work to get me in,\" says Carlson. The country was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, but a surge in military recruiting had run into the reality that the Iraq war would be long and bloody. Guard units started activating for year-long combat tours. That was fine with Carlson. \"I was like, I'm good at this. Like, I can do this, and I feel … a type of like purpose with this,\" he said. His Wisconsin National Guard unit arrived at a small base outside Dhuluiya, Iraq, in 2004, just as the war entered its bloodiest years. His unit got assigned to mostly standing in watchtowers and securing gates. But Carlson wanted to do more, and he started asking around the active duty army units to volunteer for patrol. \"I bounced around different squads, going out depending on my schedule. I would pull guard duty for like eight hours and then I would go on mission with them. Or I would get dropped off after a mission and then I'd go on guard duty,\" he said. One of the sergeants he'd ask to take him on missions was Alwyn Cashe. Cashe would later be recognized as one of the greatest heroes of the entire Iraq war. But at the time he was just the guy Carlson had to pester about going out on patrols. Carlson remembers himself as a \"snot-nosed\" private, sometimes waking-up Sgt. Cashe to ask for permission to go out. \"And he put up with it,\" Carlson said. Eventually, after Carlson had volunteered for enough extra work, and kept his cool through enough gunfire, the squad leaders started to invite him to come. \"I've felt like my entire life to anybody that accepts me, I just give a fierce loyalty to them. And so that was, it was like the best thing in the world,\" he said. Toward the end of his tour, though, a unit requested Carlson for a patrol and he heard his commanding officer say no — no more guardsmen for patrols. After a whole year, he just wanted to bring all his troops back to Wisconsin alive. That might sound reasonable to families back home, but not to Carlson. \"For you to make it home and be able to say that you brought everybody home, you're willing to deprive this other company?\" Carlson fumed, and felt he was being made to betray the soldiers he'd built a bond with. Days later, on Oct. 17, 2005, Sgt. Cashe got ambushed. The initial explosion disabled his Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and somehow soaked Cashe's uniform with diesel fuel. Pulling a soldier out of the burning vehicle , Cashe was set aflame. On fire, he returned to the Bradley again and again, hauling seven of his men out while bullets flew around him. Cashe boarded the medevac last. It took three weeks for him to die of the burns that covered his body. Years later <a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2877110/biden-awards-medal-of-honor-to-soldiers/\" target=\"_blank\">Cashe was finally recognized with the military's highest award</a> — one of only eight people to receive the Medal of Honor during the entire Iraq war, and the first Black recipient since Vietnam. But at the time, back in Dhuluiya, Iraq, all it meant to Dave Carlson was that he had failed to go on a mission where he might have helped — or even died in place of one of the other men. Carlson redeployed home to Wisconsin, haunted by nightmares. \"So I was just in a really bad head space. I think part of the nightmares were about the fact that there were people still over there dying. Every day I was tormented, feeling like a coward, just not feeling like it was right,\" he said. A second deployment to Iraq in 2007 assuaged his guilt but cemented what the VA would later diagnose as PTSD. Returning to civilian life Carlson fell into several years of drifting, sometimes homeless, racking up theft and drug charges. By 2012 he landed at a maximum security prison north of Milwaukee. <h3>God and the Devil in Solitary</h3> I started talking to Carlson by phone at the end of his nearly 4-year prison stint. We compared notes on our times in Iraq, and there was a lot of overlap. When he arrived on his first deployment, I'd been embedded with Marines in Fallujah to the southwest of him. Around when Cashe was ambushed I'd been embedded with Army Strykers to the north, in Mosul. Carlson opened up about some of the darkest days of his life there in prison. With his mind still tortured by PTSD, he'd gotten so angry and depressed that he had plotted a suicide attack against the prison guards. He planned to make a shank and then slice his own throat in front of the guards' window and bleed out, just to give them the sort of PTSD nightmares that tormented Carlson. He went back into combat mode, and devised military tactics for fighting in jail cells — like dropping a slick of baby oil in front of his cell door, so any assailant would slip on the way in. His violent behavior eventually got him put in solitary confinement. Alone, with nothing but the screaming and banging from other prisoners in solitary cells, Carlson said he hallucinated that the devil was locked in the hole with him. \"There's no TV, there's no radio, there's none, none of that stuff. And dealing with that was very hard for me. It really took me outta that hole and really a completely new perspective that I've never had once in my entire life,\" he said. \"It was either kill myself or, or come to God, basically,\" he told me from prison. He started reading the Bible and found comfort and meaning in Christianity, and a message that he needed to serve again. \"I think that for the chances that I've been given to even be worth it at this point, I need to go out and help others. I can't just go out and enjoy my life, I need to go out and selflessly pursue helping other people that are in my position. I feel like I can maybe help prevent them from going down the same road that I did,\" he said. Before he could do that, he needed to get out of prison. That's what he hoped was going to happen at that sentencing hearing in Waukesha. Judge Hassin thought otherwise. \"I'm looking at a fine young man sitting here in front of me today that I'm gonna end up putting in prison for a little bit,\" the judge said, \"The sentence today is two years on each count.\" At first that sounded like four more years in prison, and Carlson's Iraq buddies exchanged worried looks. But then the judge explained it was concurrent with time served, so Carlson would actually be out in a couple of months, with 12 years of extended supervision and 3 years of probation. \"I'm giving you the challenge, sir, of leaving the state prison system here in a fairly short period of time. But you know what? You can do it. You're very capable of it, Mr. Carlson. These guys behind you believe that you're capable of it today as well or they wouldn't be here, right?\" said the judge. Carlson quietly answered, \"Yes, sir.\" \"OK. So to them, you owe something too, right?\" said the judge. A few hours later on the jail payphone, Carlson was elated. \"At the end, he called me a fine young man, and honestly, it wouldn't have mattered what sentence he gave me. That meant that meant a lot to me. I think that through all of this, that's all I've been looking for is just for people to see that I've meant well, and that I went down the wrong road,\" Carlson said. <h3>A free man</h3> Dave Carlson walked out of jail, a free man, on Dec. 30, 2015. He moved into an apartment his grandma had rented for him, and hunkered down. I called him up two weeks after that, and he sounded a bit bewildered. \"It was like shell shock at first. The first couple days were really bad. It took about a week before I could get my bearings and stuff. Just trying to act like I'm back in the world and life is life now, you know?\" he told me. Even though Carlson had been stateside for seven years at this point, he'd been in prisons or institutions for much of that time. When I checked in on him again after a couple of months, he sounded better. He'd met a woman at one of the two gyms where he'd been teaching boxing. \"It's nothing super serious. We do a lot of workouts together and stuff,\" Carlson said. It would get serious though. \"I will never forget the day that he walked into this gym,\" remembers Alicia Carlson, who is now Dave's wife. She didn't like him at first, but he made an impression. \"He had on high-top Jordan tennis shoes, a sweat-like tracksuit and just serious, like the most serious person I've ever seen,\" she said. There was a stretch before I checked in with Carlson again. And things had changed. He and Alicia were married and had a baby boy. But they'd already been through a lot, and Carlson had slipped. Just as he and Alicia started their relationship, Dave Carlson's best friend from his criminal days was murdered. That, along with his continuing PTSD combat nightmares, was enough to knock Carlson off course. Alicia realized something was off one night when Dave decided he'd have a drink with dinner. \"I don't know if this is Pandora's box opening or what just happened,\" Alicia told me later. She said it led to many months of relapses. That's not uncommon for recovering addicts, but Carlson didn't have any leeway. He was still under supervision by the court, one drunken traffic stop away from getting hauled back to prison. Right after their baby was born, Dave plain disappeared. \"I had a brand new baby. He was completely out of his mind,\" said Alicia. Alicia finally tracked him down to a motel in a rough part of town. She found him, drunk and snorting cocaine off of a desk. \"I wanted to die,\" Dave remembers. \"I didn't want to take on the responsibility of being a dad. I knew that I was gonna suck at it and I was gonna teach my kids all kinds of bad s***. So maybe my dad, it was best that he was not in my life for the majority of it, because maybe I would've just been even worse off? And maybe I'm gonna do that to my kids.\" Alicia marched him to an inpatient rehab at the VA in St. Cloud, Minn. I was always hoping Carlson was going to make it. But by then I'd been reporting on veterans for six or seven years, and I'd seen lots of them fail. Suicide long ago outstripped combat as a killer. More than four times as many Iraq and Afghanistan war vets have <a href=\"https://costsofwar.watson.brown.edu/paper/high-suicide-rates-among-united-states-service-members-and-veterans-post-911-wars\" target=\"_blank\">taken their own lives than </a>died in both wars. The stress often ricochetted on to military families and spouses, like Alicia. But she wasn't ready to give up on their marriage. \"It was like, I'm just gonna do whatever I need to. I want to get David back on the rails because I feel like if I can get him help — he has so much potential. This is just a part of his story. I believe that he has so much more to offer this world and he's here for a reason,\" Alicia said. Maybe it was holding his new baby in the peace and stability of the VA hospital. Maybe it was Alicia's dedication, or Dave's growing sense of serving God. Most likely all those things, but Dave Carlson finally found a way to turn all his anger and trauma and energy in a direction more suited for life outside of war.  \"There's a quote about 'I would rather be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war,\" he told me. \"It speaks to being able to defend yourself, to be able to do harm, but then having the discipline, having the empathy, having the compassion to not do it,\" he said. After Dave came home from rehab, Alicia said, little good things kept happening. She finished grad school, and they bought their first house with a VA home loan. \"And then he got into law school and that was just like, whoa, like I can't believe this is happening,\" she said. In those years our phone conversations got to be less like interviews, as we compared notes on becoming new fathers, and discussed the wars that were still ongoing. Carlson was one of the people I talked with after my close friend, NPR's photographer David Gilkey, died in a Taliban ambush in 2016. Carlson got it; he mostly just listened. <h3>Put to the test</h3> We kept checking in by phone, and then by Zoom, as big things happened in the world — a pandemic and racial justice protests. Carlson seemed to be on track. He and Alicia had a second baby — another boy. And they'd started a company to mentor troubled youth. Finding a new mission, and for veterans feeling a sense of service, is one of the best ways I've seen people get over war and PTSD. Carlson knew these kids looked up to him because he's strong, and because he'd fought at war. But he wanted to teach them a different lesson about fighting than the one he grew up with. \"I thought, then, that the value was the actual violence — being able to do that violence to other people. It just needed to be deserving people that you did the violence to, which is backwards. Now I fully believe and know that violence of any kind is wrong. It's the least effective way to do anything,\" Carlson said. Carlson was trying to live that way — a warrior in a garden. His work with troubled youth and other social services sometimes brought him into volatile situations though. That's what he described to me on a call in 2023. Driving home one evening, Carlson said he got a troubling message from a colleague who worked in domestic violence. A woman had texted her, saying that her husband planned to rape and kill her. The husband, a felon, had posted pictures of himself online with weapons. Carlson turned around and went to get his colleague, and they drove together to pick up the wife and her children. They planned not to go inside the house, especially since Carlson was still on probation. \"So we get to the front of the house. And there is a door open on the car, and no wife out there,\" Carlson said. His colleague jumped out of the car and ran into the house. \"I'm yelling at her like, stop, stop, stop!\" Carlson said. So much for the plan. \"And so I go in after. And I'm playing in my mind … like a flashback to Iraq. My brain is now processing this as if someone has just kicked the door, and I'm second-man-in,\" he said. In Iraq that had meant: one soldier kicks in the door, and the second-man runs into a dark, unknown house that might be full of armed men. Back then his mindset was kill or be killed. Now he was rushing into a domestic dispute in an American city. \"The wife is in the corner, like cowering in the corner. I get in between the wife and the husband,\" he said. The husband was a larger man, but Carlson rushed at him, hoping he wasn't armed. \"I grabbed the hand that I couldn't see any longer while at the same time grabbing his neck,\" said Carlson. They crashed down the hallway and rolled on to the floor. \"I think I put one leg around, like a hook in jiujitsu around his thigh, and I'm peeking around his head trying to see if there's anything in his hand,\" he said. Despite his memories of house-clearing in Iraq, Carlson wasn't having a PTSD flashback. He wasn't having a relapse. Instead he was keeping it together and using the skills learned as a soldier. The man's hand was empty. Carlson wrapped his giant arm into what's called a rear-naked choke hold. A nd then it was done. He told the husband to stay down, and he did. The wife and kids were safe. The police arrived, and Carlson told them he had been involved. He called his probation officer. He figured he was going to jail. \"I went straight to the gas station. I bought six hard boiled eggs. I ate six hard boiled eggs, went to the courthouse and then waited,\" he said. As an ex-con, he knew the drill. \"I thought for sure I was going to jail! You get hungry as hell in jail. So… fill up!\" he said with a laugh. This time when Carlson ended up before a judge though, he knew what to say. And he didn't go to jail. He went home and he kept on studying for his law degree. Then this past spring I called Dave Carlson not for an interview, but to plan a trip to go see him in Wisconsin for his law school graduation. <h3>Two questions</h3> I stopped by Carlson's house before graduation, with that same original question in mind: How do you get over war? When we sat down to talk, though, he surprised me with a question of his own: Why have you been interviewing me for the past 10 years? Somehow, even a decade in, I didn't have an articulate response. But Carlson knew the answer, and he told me. \"Your recovery depends on the person you work with, with their recovery,\" he said. It's a concept he learned from Alcoholic Anonymous. \"I think you're part of this, you're part of this network. The same way I'm a part of your recovery, you're part of my recovery.\" He's right. I went to war as a correspondent, not a soldier. But I spent 15 years reporting on senseless death and destruction, and I lost friends along the way. Talking to Dave Carlson and telling his story, and other veterans' stories on NPR was the best possible thing I could have done to move forward with my life. Doing that for all these years had helped me digest what we'd all been through, and slowly redefine myself with a new purpose back here at home. As for my question about how Carlson could get past the war, the answer seemed clear as we sat in his house in Eau Claire, big enough for his three boys to have their own bedrooms. He and Alicia seemed happy walking the kids to a playground just down the street. In my mind his odyssey is over, home at last. But that's not how he sees it. Carslon said he's still just keeping the wolves at bay. \"I mean honestly like, I don't think it's ever safe,\" he told me. \"But I think that if you can build the community that you have, the network that you have for support and that network is stable, I think maybe you can relax a certain amount. Because somebody's got your six, right?\" he said. \"Right now I think that I'm trying to tighten up my sector of fire. So that when I do relax, I can just enjoy those relationships and my family can thrive without there being some impending danger looming just ahead.\" I left his house in Eau Claire with a more tempered view. Still I hope that some day soon he'll be able to let his guard down, relax, and feel safe, maybe even a little proud. I just spoke to Dave Carlson last week, and he was at the courthouse again. He passed the bar, and he's now a practicing attorney.",

    "title": "Trump issues two pardons related to Jan. 6 investigation",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has issued two pardons related to the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 riot, including for a woman convicted of threatening to shoot FBI agents who were investigating a tip that she may have been at the Capitol, officials said Saturday. In a separate case, Trump issued a second pardon for a Jan. 6 defendant who had remained behind bars despite the sweeping grant of clemency for Capitol rioters because of a separate conviction for illegally possessing firearms. It's the latest example of Trump's willingness to use his constitutional authority to help supporters who were scrutinized as part of the Biden administration's massive Jan. 6 investigation that led to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/21/nx-s1-5268919/trump-issues-jan-6-pardons-attack-capitol-clemency\">charges against more than 1,500 defendants</a>. Suzanne Ellen Kaye was released last year after serving an 18-month sentence in her threats case. After FBI contacted her in 2021 about a tip indicating she may have been at the Capitol on Jan. 6, she posted a video on social media citing her Second Amendment right to carry a gun and she threatened to shoot agents if they came to her house. In court papers, prosecutors said her words \"were part of the ubiquity of violent political rhetoric that causes serious harm to our communities.\" An email seeking comment was sent to a lawyer for Kaye on Saturday. Kaye testified at trial that she didn't own any guns and didn't intend to threaten the FBI, according to court papers. She told authorities she was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and wasn't charged with any Capitol riot-related crimes. A White House official said Kaye suffers from \"stress-induced seizures,\" and experienced one when the jury read its verdict. The White House said this is \"clearly a case of disfavored First Amendment political speech being prosecuted and an excessive sentence.\" The official requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the case. In a separate case, Trump pardoned <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/kentucky-man-sentenced-five-years-prison-felony-conspiracy-charge-actions-during-jan-6\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Edwin Wilson</a> of Louisville, Kentucky, who was under investigation for his role in the riot when authorities found six guns and roughly 4,800 rounds of ammunition in his home. Because of prior felony convictions, it was illegal for him to possess firearms. Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Trump's sweeping pardons for Jan. 6 rioters in January applied to other crimes discovered during the sprawling federal dragnet that began after the attack on the Capitol. The Trump-appointed federal judge who oversaw Wilson's case criticized the Justice Department earlier this year for arguing that the president's Jan. 6 pardons applied to Wilson's gun offense. Wilson, who had been scheduled to remain in prison until 2028, was released Friday evening following the pardon, his lawyer said on Saturday. \"We are grateful that President Trump has recognized the injustice in my client's case and granted him this pardon,\" attorney George Pallas said in an email. \"Mr. Wilson can now reunite with his family and begin rebuilding his life.\" The White House official said Saturday that \"because the search of Mr. Wilson's home was due to the events of January 6, and they should have never been there in the first place, President Trump is pardoning Mr. Wilson for the firearm issues.\" Wilson had been sentenced in 2024 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to impede or injure police officers and illegally possessing firearms at his home. Prosecutors had accused him of planning for the Jan. 6 riot for weeks and coming to Washington with the goal of stopping the peaceful transfer of power. Authorities said he communicated with members of the far-right Oath Keepers extremist group and adherents of the antigovernment Three Percenters movement as he marched to the Capitol. Prosecutors cited messages they argued showed that Wilson's \"plans were for a broader American civil war.\" In one message on Nov. 9, 2020, he wrote: \"I'm willing to do whatever. Done made up my mind. I understand the tip of the spear will not be easy. I'm willing to sacrifice myself if necessary. Whether it means prison or death.\" Wilson said at his sentencing that he regretted entering the Capitol that day but \"got involved with good intentions.\" The Justice Department had initially argued in February that Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6 rioters on his first day back in the White House didn't extend to Wilson's gun crime. The department later changed its position, saying it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\" U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, criticized the department's evolving position and said it was \"extraordinary\" that prosecutors were seeking to argue that Trump's Jan. 6 pardons extended to illegal \"contraband\" found by investigators during searches related to the Jan. 6 cases. Politico first reported Wilson's pardon on Saturday. Megerian reported from West Palm Beach, Fla.",

She was diagnosed at birth with muscular dystrophy, a progressive neuromuscular disease that slowly weakened her muscles and doctors told her parents that she wouldn't live to the age of 18. \"I struggled a lot as a child,\" Wong said in a <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/forum/2010101908618/bay-area-legends-activist-alice-wong-and-the-power-of-bringing-visibility-to-disability\" target=\"_blank\">segment</a> recorded earlier this year for NPR member station KQED. \"I felt so alone and angry. I was mainstreamed in public schools and was usually the only disabled student in a classroom and or one of a handful of Asian American students.\" She continued, \"I had to grow up very fast advocating for myself with adults such as teachers and doctors, even though I didn't have the language for what I was experiencing.\" Despite her many challenges, Wong earned a bachelor's degree from Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis followed by a master's<strong> </strong>degree from the University of California, San Francisco. After graduating,<strong> </strong>she worked at her San Francisco alma mater as a staff research associate for more than a decade. Meanwhile, her career in disability advocacy flourished. Following a series of medical emergencies in 2022, Wong began communicating through digital text-to-speech technology. In her 2022 memoir <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/688504/year-of-the-tiger-by-alice-wong/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Year of the Tiger: An Activist's Life</em></a>, the author describes herself as a \"disabled cyborg\" – a person \"tethered to equipment, technology and electricity to keep alive.\" In addition to raising the profile of disabled people, Wong strove to dismantle systemic ableism in the U.S. She wrote about her opposition to the <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2018/7/19/17586742/plastic-straw-ban-disabilities\" target=\"_blank\">ban on drinking straws</a> and the need to enforce the wearing of <a href=\"https://www.deathpanel.net/transcripts/alice-wong-ucsf\" target=\"_blank\">masks in health care settings</a>. A social media power-user, Wong co-founded <a href=\"https://cripthevote.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">#CripTheVote</a> in 2016, a nonpartisan online movement facilitates discussions about disability issues between voters and politicians. <h2><strong>Taking advocacy further</strong></h2> Wong was a prolific writer who received acclaim for <em>Year of the Tiger</em>.<em> </em>NPR <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/02/04/1153937530/activist-alice-wong-lunar-new-year-year-of-the-tiger-rabbit\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> the book as highlighting the author's passion for \"living an unapologetic, unabashed disabled life filled with science-fiction, good food, and cats.\" Wong's literary activities also encompassed editing several works on disability, and contributing a <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/contributor/alice-wong\" target=\"_blank\">column</a> to <em>Teen Vogue</em>. \"Alice is my comrade in political struggle. She's my friend. She's a foodie. She's an artist,\" said disability and social justice organizer Yomi Sachiko Young of Wong in a 2025 <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/forum/2010101908618/bay-area-legends-activist-alice-wong-and-the-power-of-bringing-visibility-to-disability\" target=\"_blank\">segment</a> for KQED. \"She's a bit bougie, which I love.\" Wong also took her advocacy to the nation's capital. She attended a White House reception for the 25th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 2015 <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/photos-and-video/photo/2015/07/president-obama-greets-alice-wong-robot\" target=\"_blank\">through a telepresence robot</a>. She was the first person to visit the White House and a U.S. President – in this case, Barack Obama – via a robot \"surrogate,\" according to <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/first-telepresence-robot-visits-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Popular Science</em></a>. Wong served, at Obama's behest, on the National Council on Disability from 2013 to 2015. Speaking with her digital voice on KQED in Feb. 2025, Wong said she was \"radically committed to a life of pleasure and joy.\" She talked about her enjoyment of cooking for others, including twice-weekly lunches for her elderly parents, and caring for her cats, Bert and Ernie. \"Being able to use my privilege to pass on opportunities to other disabled people and support projects I believe in brings me so much joy,\" Wong said. \"We live in such bleak times and what keeps me going is living to the maximum without apology.",

    "title": "A red meat allergy caused by ticks killed a N.J. man. Here's what to know",
    "text": "Researchers say they believe they've documented the first known death from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/04/02/1166431106/ticks-ick-the-latest-science-on-the-red-meat-allergy-caused-by-some-tick-bites\" target=\"_blank\">alpha-gal syndrome</a> — a red meat allergy caused by tick bites. The findings, by researchers at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, published in the <a href=\"https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198%2825%2900953-5/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</em></a>. The report says a 47-year-old airplane pilot in New Jersey fell ill four hours after eating a hamburger at a barbecue in 2024. The man's son found him unconscious on the floor of a bathroom surrounded by vomit. The man was declared dead at a hospital. The autopsy cited a \"sudden unexplained death.\" Two weeks before he died, the man had become ill several hours after eating a steak dinner, waking up with abdominal discomfort, writhing in pain, having diarrhea and vomiting. \"I thought I was going to die,\" he told his son. But the man and his wife decided not to consult a doctor, saying they weren't sure how to explain what had happened. A blood sample collected after the man's death showed he had an allergic reaction. His wife said that earlier that summer, he had 12 or 13 \"chigger,\" or tiny mite larvae, bites around his ankles that left itchy, small bumps. But scientists believe those bites were actually from larvae of lone star ticks, which can cause alpha-gal syndrome. <h3><strong>What is alpha-gal syndrome?</strong></h3> Alpha-gal syndrome is a tick-borne illness that causes a red meat allergy. Alpha-gal is a sugar molecule found in mammals like cows, pigs and lambs. It's also found in the saliva of some ticks. Humans don't produce the molecule so when a tick transmits it, alpha-gal can produce a hive-like rash or an anaphylactic reaction about 2-6 hours after a person consumes meat. \"It is like it is trying to fight off,\" said Saravanan Thangamani, who directs the SUNY Center for Vector-Borne Diseases at Upstate Medical University. \"It is a foreign body. But basically, as a result of that, we have this anaphylactic shock or allergy.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were more than 110,000 suspected cases identified between 2010 and 2022. But the CDC said the number of cases is likely higher, with as many as 450,000 people affected, as many people are unaware of the allergy and it requires a diagnostic test. In a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7230a2.htm?s_cid=mm7230a2_w\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> released in July 2023, the CDC said 42% of surveyed health care providers had never heard of the disease. The American Gastroenterological Association advises people with unexplained diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain to be tested for alpha-gal syndrome. In the U.S., alpha-gal syndrome is primarily associated with lone star ticks, according to the CDC. Most reported cases occur in the South, East and Central states, where lone star ticks are common. Thangamani, who runs the Upstate Tick Testing Laboratory in New York, said the number of lone star tick encounters this year in that state sent to his lab doubled from 2024. And he notes a trend of lone star ticks migrating north. \"In 2023, we received ticks from seven counties in New York State that are lone star tick encounters,\" Thangamani said. \"This year we got about 15 counties. In addition to increasing numbers, they're also expanding in geographic range, so this is a cause of concern.\" <h3><strong>How can I protect myself?</strong></h3> There is no vaccine to prevent alpha-gal syndrome. After infection, physicians recommend patients change their diet to avoid consuming meat such as beef, pork, lamb, venison, or rabbit. Thangamani said preventing tick bites is key to avoiding tick-borne illnesses. This includes wearing repellent like DEET, protective clothing and avoiding tick habitats. If you are bitten by a tick, remove it as quickly as possible and save it in a plastic bag. That way doctors could identify what kind of tick it is and even test it for disease. \"We can't reduce the tick exposure, but if we can remove the tick as soon as we come from an outdoor activity, we essentially eliminate a lot of issues that arise after a tick bite,\" Thangamani said.",

    "text": "The world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, arrived in the Caribbean Sea on Sunday, as tensions with Venezuela grow. The carrier, which has more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of tactical aircraft on board, has joined 15,000 service members already stationed in the region. \"The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group's deployment represents a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland,\" said Admiral Alvin Holsey, of U.S. Southern Command, <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/MEDIA/NEWS-ARTICLES/Article/4332637/gerald-r-ford-carrier-strike-group-enters-caribbean-sea/\" target=\"_blank\">in a statement.</a> Earlier this week, a U.S. military official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR the \"table is being set\" for possible military action in the region. Administration officials are continuing to hold high-level meetings with members of Congress and foreign leaders amid ongoing military exercises. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Thursday <a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430\" target=\"_blank\">on social media</a> that a \"mission\" was under way called \"Operation Southern Spear.\" \"This mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,\" he wrote. \"The Western Hemisphere is America's neighborhood and we will protect it.\" It remains unclear, however, if President Trump will use military force against Venezuela. The U.S. has conducted 20 strikes on boats in the region so far, saying they were ferrying drugs trafficked from the country. In August, the U.S. government set a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/nicolas-maduro-moros\" target=\"_blank\">$50 million reward</a> for the arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. But officials told NPR that the arrival of the USS Gerald Ford, which was pulled from the Mediterranean Sea, could be just another pressure tactic on Maduro, who has put his own forces on high alert. On Friday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, \"I sort of made up my mind\" about whether to launch an attack. \"I can't tell you what it is,\" he said, \"but we made a lot of progress with Venezuela in terms of stopping drugs from pouring in.\" The increased activity comes after the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/18/nx-s1-5577941/adm-alvin-holsey-who-was-overseeing-the-venezuelan-boat-strikes-steps-down\" target=\"_blank\">high-profile resignation</a> last month of U.S. four-star Adm. Alvin Holsey, who had been overseeing the boat strikes. He abruptly left his post two years early. Pentagon sources told NPR they believe it was because he objected to the assaults on the alleged drug boats, which have so far killed 80 people, and struck boats that did not appear to be showing any immediate hostile intent. <em>NPR's Tom Bowman, Quil Lawrence and Lydia Calitri</em> <em>contributed to this report.</em>",

    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Todd Snider, a singer whose thoughtfully freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure in American roots music, has died. He was 59. His record label said Saturday in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRFN5XnEXKH/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday. \"Where do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?\" the statement read. \"Always creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\" Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRDOlqhAdw9/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team. But Salt Lake City police later arrested Snider himself when he at first refused to leave a hospital and later returned and threatened staffers, the <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2025/11/07/todd-snider-told-cops-hes-not-bad/\" target=\"_blank\">Salt Lake Tribune</a> reported. The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \"High, Lonesome and Then Some,\" which released in October. Snider combined elements of folk, rock and country in a three-decade career. In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/todd-snider-crank-doomed-music-review-ca20840be36fa97e20a82ab56aa12e6a\" target=\"_blank\">\"singer-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\"</a> and a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-reviews-484c02f10973ef4f52672b3b8b450681\" target=\"_blank\">\"stoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\"</a> He modeled himself on — and at times met and was mentored by — artists like Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Prine. His songs were recorded by artists including Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver and Tom Jones. And he co-wrote a song with Loretta Lynn that appeared on her 2016 album, \"Full Circle.\" \"He relayed so much tenderness and sensitivity through his songs, and showed many of us how to look at the world through a different lens,\" the Saturday statement from his label read. \"He got up every morning and started writing, always working towards finding his place among the songwriting giants that sat on his record shelves, those same giants who let him into their lives and took him under their wings, who he studied relentlessly.\" Snider would do his best-known and most acclaimed work for Prine's independent label Oh Boy in the early 2000s. It included the albums \"New Connection,\" \"Near Truths and Hotel Rooms\" and \"East Nashville Skyline,\" a 2004 collection that's considered by many to be his best. Those albums yielded his best known songs, \"I Can't Complain,\" \"Beer Run\" and \"Alright Guy.\" Snider was born and raised in Oregon before settling and making his musical chops in San Marcos, Texas. He eventually made his way to Nashville, and was dubbed by some the unofficial \"mayor of East Nashville,\" assuming the title from a friend memorialized thusly in his \"Train Song.\" In 2021, Snider said a tornado that ripped through the neighborhood home to a vibrant arts scene severely damaged his house. Snider had an early fan in Jimmy Buffett, who signed the young artist to his record label, Margaritaville, which released his first two albums, 1994's \"Songs for the Daily Planet\" and 1996's \"Step Right Up.",

    "title": "Judge indefinitely bars Trump from fining UC over alleged discrimination",
    "text": "The Trump administration cannot fine the University of California or summarily cut the school system's federal funding over claims it allows antisemitism or other forms of discrimination, a federal judge ruled late Friday in a sharply worded decision. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction barring the administration from cancelling funding to UC based on alleged discrimination without giving notice to affected faculty and conducting a hearing, among other requirements. The administration over the summer demanded the University of California, Los Angeles pay $1.2 billion to restore frozen research funding and ensure eligibility for future funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus. UCLA was the first public university to be targeted by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations. It has also frozen or paused federal funding over similar claims against private colleges, including Columbia University. In her ruling, Lin said labor unions and other groups representing UC faculty, students and employees had provided \"overwhelming evidence\" that the Trump administration was \"engaged in a concerted campaign to purge 'woke,' 'left,' and 'socialist' viewpoints from our country's leading universities.\" \"Agency officials, as well as the President and Vice President, have repeatedly and publicly announced a playbook of initiating civil rights investigations of preeminent universities to justify cutting off federal funding, with the goal of bringing universities to their knees and forcing them to change their ideological tune,\" Lin wrote. She added, \"It is undisputed that this precise playbook is now being executed at the University of California.\" At UC, which is facing a series of civil rights probes, she found the administration had engaged in \"coercive and retaliatory conduct in violation of the First Amendment and Tenth Amendment.\" Messages sent to the White House and the U.S. Department of Justice after hours Friday were not immediately returned. Lin's order will remain in effect indefinitely. University of California President James B. Milliken has said the size of the UCLA fine would devastate the UC system, whose campuses are viewed as some of the top public colleges in the nation. UC is in settlement talks with the administration and is not a party to the lawsuit before Lin, who was nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat. In a statement, the university system said it \"remains committed to protecting the mission, governance, and academic freedom of the University.\" The administration has demanded UCLA comply with its views on gender identity and establish a process to make sure foreign students are not admitted if they are likely to engage in anti-American, anti-Western or antisemitic \"disruptions or harassment,\" among other requirements outlined in a settlement proposal made public in October. The administration has previously struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million. Lin cited declarations by UC faculty and staff that the administration's moves were prompting them to stop teaching or researching topics they were \"afraid were too 'left' or 'woke.'\" Her injunction also blocks the administration from \"conditioning the grant or continuance of federal funding on the UC's agreement to any measures that would violate the rights of Plaintiffs' members under the First Amendment.\" She cited efforts to force the UCs to screen international students based on \"'anti-Western\" or \"'anti-American'\" views, restrict research and teaching, or adopt specific definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" as examples of such measures. President Donald Trump has decried elite colleges as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. His administration has launched investigations of dozens of universities, claiming they have failed to end the use of racial preferences in violation of civil rights law. The Republican administration says diversity, equity and inclusion efforts discriminate against white and Asian American students.",

    "title": "A stock of U.S.-bought birth control, meant for sub-Saharan Africa, goes bad in Belgium",
    "text": "There's a new twist in the saga of the U.S.-purchased contraceptives intended for sub-Saharan Africa and stuck in Belgium since the Trump administration scaled back foreign aid earlier this year. This week, questions were raised about whether the stockpile, originally valued at $9.7 million, might be bigger than previously thought. And an official on the ground said some of those products have gone bad. Authorities in the Flanders region of Belgium confirmed that in addition to the four truckloads' worth of unexpired birth control sitting in a warehouse in the city of Geel, another 20 truckloads of supplies ended up in the village of Kallo but were stored improperly and are therefore unusable — at least as contraceptives. \"The medicines in the 20 relocated shipments, due to non-compliant storage, cannot be brought back into circulation,\" Jo Brouns, the Flemish minister of the environment, <a href=\"https://www.vlaamsparlement.be/nl/parlementaire-documenten/schriftelijke-vragen/1940857\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in published responses</a> to a lawmaker's question. \"On the other hand, the medical devices in these shipments, such as syringes for injected contraceptives, are still eligible for reuse — provided the other pharmaceutical requirements are met.\" Along with the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/11/g-s1-47661/trump-musk-usaid-ukraine-south-africa-mexico-colombia-india-afghanistan-hiv\" target=\"_blank\">dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development</a> (USAID) earlier this year, the U.S. specifically halted family planning programs — for which it had long been the world's largest bilateral donor — because it did not consider them <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-u-s-family-planning-and-reproductive-health-efforts/#:~:text=Funding%20freeze/stop%2Dwork%20order,waiver%20issued%20on%20February%204.\" target=\"_blank\">lifesaving</a>, despite vast evidence showing such services reduce maternal and newborn deaths. As a result, a shipment of contraceptives that had been earmarked for girls and women in a number of low-income countries — including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Mali, Tanzania and Zambia — ended up stranded in Belgium. Several aid groups tried to buy and redistribute the supply of IUDs, implants and pills, but said the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5482742/the-u-s-is-destroying-9-7-million-in-contraceptives-is-there-another-option\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. rejected their offers</a>. The Trump administration has cited a policy that bars foreign organizations from using U.S. funds to provide abortion services, even though the products in the stockpile do not include any abortion methods. Then, in July, the State Department confirmed that it planned to use taxpayer money to incinerate the products in France by the end of the month, even though they wouldn't expire until 2027 at the earliest. That sparked an outcry from humanitarian groups worldwide, including the <a href=\"https://www.rhsupplies.org/news-events/news/rh-alert-the-true-cost-behind-destroying-9-7m-of-contraceptives/\" target=\"_blank\">Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition</a> (RHSC), which said the destruction of the single stockpile could result in 362,000 unintended pregnancies, 161,000 unplanned births, 110,000 unsafe abortions and 718 preventable maternal deaths. The government's late-July deadline came and went without confirmation of the destruction, giving aid groups hope. And in September, after USAID told <em>The New York Times</em> that the stocks had been destroyed, Belgian authorities checked the warehouse and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5511304/birth-control-foreign-aid-destruction-belgium-warehouse\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed they were still there</a>. As Brouns confirmed this week, it turns out those weren't the only contraceptives left in limbo. <h3><strong>What's in those truckloads? The disclosure raises more questions </strong></h3> Brouns said his administration conducted an on-site inspection of the warehouse in mid-August after hearing the products were being shipped to France. \"There appeared to be no planned shipments to France,\" he wrote. \"However, it was determined that 20 of the 24 shipments in total had already been transferred to another storage location in Kallo, which is not specifically equipped for the storage of medicines.\" It is not clear exactly what kinds of products were transferred to Kallo or if they were part of the original stockpile. NPR has reached out to the State Department for more information but did not hear back by publication time. Marcel van Valen, head of supply chain at International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), told NPR over email they believe the 20 truckloads are \"additional products at risk of incineration\" on top of the $9.7 million in the warehouse.  <h3><strong>Aid groups want the rest distributed before it's too late</strong></h3> Brouns, the Flemish minister, stressed that while the contraceptives in Kallo cannot be reused, their medical hardware can. That's in addition to the shipments stored in the Geel warehouse. Brouns wrote that his administration is in close contact with the minister of foreign affairs, adding that \"diplomatic discussions and efforts are indeed crucial for these resources to still be put to (re)use.\" Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-funded-contraceptives-stuck-belgium-risk-becoming-unusable-by-mid-2026-2025-10-16/\" target=\"_blank\">reported in October</a> that such talks between the U.S. and Belgium were paused during the government shutdown. Humanitarian groups are calling on the Trump administration to release the products — either to a nongovernmental organization or a foreign government. Chiara Cosentino, coordinator for Countdown 2030 Europe — a coalition of European reproductive rights organizations — said in a statement that the administration's \"apparent strategy is to let these life-saving supplies expire rather than share them with those who need and want them.\" \"It is unacceptable that the Trump Administration is holding hostage more than $9.7 million worth of U.S.-funded contraceptives — along with the health and well-being of 1.4 million women and girls in the Global South,\" she added. The sub-Saharan African countries where these products are needed — many of which are already experiencing humanitarian crises — are facing worsening contraceptive shortages as a result of the Trump administration's reduction in foreign aid. \"Since the discontinuation of USAID support, it has become much more difficult to continue our services,\" Dr. Bakari Omary, project coordinator of IPPF's member association in Tanzania, said <a href=\"https://europe.ippf.org/media-center/press-release-belgian-and-european-governments-must-act-save-usaid-supplies-and-not\" target=\"_blank\">in a statement</a>. \"Previously, anyone who wanted to avoid pregnancy could come to us and choose the contraceptive that suited them. Now women have to switch to whatever is available, or we cannot help them.\" Reproductive health advocates say the products stuck in Belgium are only part of the problem and that there are likely more contraceptives held up at other points in the global supply chain. One group, <a href=\"https://pai.org/resources/an-unhealthy-obsession-the-cruelty-behind-cuts-to-family-planning-programs-proposed-by-the-trump-administration-and-house-republicans/\" target=\"_blank\">PAI, says</a> the value of contraceptives supplies already purchased by the U.S. government but stuck in limbo at risk of expiration could be as high as $40 million.",

    "title": "Pope Leo returns 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada",
    "text": "VATICAN CITY — The Vatican on Saturday returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada, a historic restitution that is part of the Catholic Church's reckoning with its role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas. Pope Leo XIV gave the artifacts, including an iconic Inuit kayak, and supporting documentation to a delegation of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is expected to return them to individual Indigenous communities. A joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church described the pieces as a \"gift\" and a \"concrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity.\" The items were part of the Vatican Museum's ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural goods taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods. Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens. The Vatican insists the items were \"gifts\" to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church's global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized. But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government's forced assimilation policy of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \"cultural genocide.\" Part of that policy included confiscating items used in Indigenous spiritual and traditional rituals, such as the 1885 potlatch ban that prohibited the integral First Nations ceremony. Those confiscated items ended up in museums in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, as well as private collections. <h3>Negotiations accelerate on returning items</h3> Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church's role in running Canada's disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including the Inuit kayak, wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned. Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \"In the case where you can return things, where it's necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\" The Vatican said Saturday the items were given back during the Holy Year, exactly 100 years after the 1925 exhibition where they were first exhibited in Rome as a highlight of that Jubilee. \"This is an act of ecclesial sharing, with which the Successor of Peter entrusts to the Church in Canada these artifacts, which bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the Indigenous peoples,\" said the joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church. It added that the Canadian Catholic hierarchy committed to ensuring that the artifacts are \"properly safeguarded, respected and preserved.\" Officials had previously said the Canadian bishops would receive the artifacts with the explicit understanding that the ultimate keepers will be the Indigenous communities themselves. The items are expected to be taken first to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec. There, experts and Indigenous groups will try to identify where the items originated, down to the specific community, and what should be done with them, officials said previously. <h3>A process of reckoning with abuses</h3> The Canadian ambassador to the Holy See, Joyce Napier, said the return had been a key priority for the Canadian government, something the embassy has been working on for years with the Holy See, Canadian church and Indigenous communities. \"This is historic, something Indigenous communities have been asking for,\" she told The Associated Press. \"Today's announcement is a significant step towards reconciliation.\" As part of its broader reckoning with the Catholic Church's colonial past, the Vatican in 2023 formally repudiated the \"Doctrine of Discovery,\" the theories backed by 15th-century \"papal bulls\" that legitimized the colonial-era seizure of Native lands that form the basis of some property laws today. The statement marked a historic recognition of the Vatican's own complicity in colonial-era abuses committed by European powers, even though it didn't address Indigenous demands that the Vatican formally rescind the papal bulls themselves. The Vatican on Saturday cited the 2023 repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery in its statement, saying Leo's return of the artifacts concludes the \"journey\" initiated by Francis.",

    "text": "Imagine this on a movie poster: \"'Two thumbs up! — Pope Leo.\" The pope meets movie stars and directors at the Vatican today, including Cate Blanchett, Chris Pine, Spike Lee, Viggo Mortensen, and Monica Bellucci, to \"deepen dialogue with the World of Cinema,\" says the Vatican. Pope Leo also revealed his four favorite movies. One is 1965's <em>The Sound of Music</em> with Julie Andrews. Great songs, great curtains, \"wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings …\" And nuns who sneak under the hood of the Gestapo's cars to remove critical parts, so the Trapp family can flee Nazi rule in Austria, climbing every mountain as they  go. Another is Frank Capra's 1946 film, <em>It's A Wonderful Life</em>. George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart, questions the worth of his life while standing on a snowy bridge. But Clarence, an angel, shows him how so many lives would be poorer without him. \"Strange, isn't it?\" asks Clarence. \"Each man's life touches so many other lives. When he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?\" The pope also lists 1980's <em>Ordinary People</em>, directed by Robert Redford, about the struggles of a family in which one son has died in an accident, and the surviving son has tried to end his life. A psychiatrist, played by Judd Hirsch, tells him, \"Feelings are scary. And sometimes they're painful. And if you can't feel pain, then you're not going to feel anything else either.\" And finally, Pope Leo cites the 1997 film, <em>Life is Beautiful</em>. Roberto Benigni plays Guido, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, sent to a concentration camp with his son. Guido dances and mugs to try to convince the little boy it's all a game, hoping to protect him from knowing the savagery that surrounds them. The film was honored and popular, but also criticized for trying to strike laughs from a concentration camp. Benigni, who's father had been in a Nazi labor camp, told <em>The Guardian</em>, \"To laugh and to cry comes from the same point of the soul, no?\" The pope's favorite flick list offers nothing avant-garde, for critics. But the movies he loves are also not all \"raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens.\" They're popular films that show glimpses of darkness, depression, and grave historical events. But as great art can, they still let in slivers of inspiration and light.",

    "title": "It's 2025, and the future has finally caught up with Stephen King's 'Running Man'",
    "text": "One tricky thing about writing dystopian fiction with staying power is that the future eventually catches up with you. Stephen King's 1982 novel <em>The Running Man </em>takes place in 2025. In his vision of, well, now, there is widespread poverty, rule by giant corporations, and exploitative entertainment that takes advantage of people who are suffering and tries to force ordinary people to despise each other. There is environmental destruction, mass surveillance and even the resurgence of polio. Just imagine. The story follows a man named Ben Richards, who tries to provide for his family and his sick kid by going on a game show also called <em>The Running Man</em>. On the show, he has to survive on the streets for 30 days while professional assassins pursue him. If he makes it, he wins a billion dollars. But, of course, nobody has ever survived. In 1987, a loose film adaptation starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cop falsely accused of murder and forced into the race as punishment. It turned the story into a campy, flashy action picture where Richards fought cartoonish villains and had to survive a three-hour arena battle rather than a 30-day dash through the real world. The new adaptation, directed by Edgar Wright, returns to the grimmer original story. Richards (played by Glen Powell) auditions for the game show run by the megacorporation known as The Network because his daughter has the flu, and Richards and his wife can't afford a doctor for her without a big prize. Dan Killian (Josh Brolin), the executive who oversees the game show empire, thinks Ben's anger and physical skill make him a perfect fit for <em>The Running Man</em>. And so Richards takes off, trying to stay ahead of the Hunters, the show's regulars who pursue and kill contestants. The chief Hunter is a celebrity named McCone (Lee Pace), who, despite being hailed as a hero by the Network and cheered by the show's bloodthirsty audience, wears a mask over his head to conceal his identity, which seems like good evidence of how thin, he knows, the line can be between being cheered and, should the wind shift, being loathed. The strongest parts of the movie are the parts when the running man, you know, runs. Wright, who directed <em>Shaun of the Dead </em>and <em>Hot Fuzz </em>as well as <em>Baby Driver </em>and <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</em>, has a good feel for offbeat action, including, here, a great confrontation inside a cheap hotel (in the book it's a YMCA) and a car chase cleverly filmed mostly from Richards' perspective inside the trunk, so that the audience feels the chaos and hears the noise in a way that feels fresher than just another medley of screeching tires and fishtailing back ends. Powell plays very well with the supporting cast, particularly Michael Cera (who goes back with Wright at least as far as <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>). Cera plays an ally who despises both the larger system and the local police. Also making a nice showing is Daniel Ezra, who ends up being invested in <em>The Running Man </em>game show in a clever update for the internet age. King didn't include the online universe in 1982, of course, but I think he certainly would have if he'd known, so it's a good addition. The biggest problem with this adaptation is that if you read the book, you probably know there are a couple of things about the ending that a major studio movie released in 2025 is unlikely to replicate. There are visuals that aren't going to happen on-screen given real-life historical events that have intervened since the publication of the novel, and there are things Stephen King will do as a storyteller that Paramount Pictures will not do as a studio. So there were always going to be some changes. Wright does a good job of navigating that as well as he can and staying much, much closer to the original than the silly Schwarzenegger version. Inevitably, though, when there's a different feel to the ending of this movie, that gives a similarly different feel to the whole story. Some of King's sharper-elbowed commentary about what it might take to escape this kind of oppressive society is blunted a bit. Ultimately, the film has to stand on its own, and it takes opportunities to play up the action that are harder in print. But it's a less effective critique of its world than the book was. With all that said, as an action movie that hits the gas, gets the running man running, and doesn't let up, it works quite well, and it's a lot of fun. Colman Domingo, who has played a lot of very noble characters in the last few years, sinks his teeth deliciously into the role of the flashy host who hypes up the mobs. They bring the whole thing in at a little over two hours, provided you don't hang around to watch all the credits, and that's a good thing in a world of action bloat. Mileage may vary depending on how you react to Powell: His not-totally-trustworthy slickness fit perfectly into the worlds of <em>Hit Man </em>and <em>Twisters</em>, and it's a slightly different fit for this. He's not a Schwarzenegger type, despite having a genuinely massive upper body here (which gets a mention only because they make sure you get many chances to admire it). He's always got a bit of a wink to him, and some of his best work in this film are the moments when there's some comedy working alongside the action. The final act doesn't feel as sharply focused as the rest (which is true of the book, also), but if you like your dystopias with a dose of high octane, you'll probably have a very good time. <em>This piece also appeared in NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour newsletter. </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/newsletter/pop-culture\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sign up for the newsletter</em></a><em> so you don't miss the next one, plus get weekly recommendations about what's making us happy.</em> <em>Listen to Pop Culture Happy Hour on </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/3xNgYt9\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/3ELR3n6\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>.</em>",

    "title": "As funding falters, young brain scientists rethink careers in research",
    "text": "A decades-long boom in brain science in the United States may be heading for a bust. Ongoing disruptions in federal funding are causing many young brain scientists to reconsider their career choice, according to leaders of the <a href=\"https://www.sfn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Society for Neuroscience</a> (SfN), which represents more than 37,000 researchers and clinicians. If those scientists change fields or leave the country, SfN officials say, it could hobble the nation's efforts to understand and treat brain disorders including Alzheimer's, autism, Parkinson's and schizophrenia. \"The U.S. has been a world leader in research for decades, and that leadership position is now at risk,\" says <a href=\"https://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu/people/john-morrison\" target=\"_blank\">John Morrison</a>, a professor at the University of California, Davis and president of SfN. Morrison expects that discussions about federal funding are likely to have a prominent place in the group's annual five-day meeting, which begins Saturday in San Diego and is expected to attract about 20,000 brain scientists. \"It's hard to escape, because we're all being directly affected by it,\" Morrison says. <h3>Science, disrupted</h3> In the months since President Trump took office, the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation have been buffeted by cuts, grant terminations, and abrupt policy changes. Federal health officials have said those measures reflect an effort to reduce fraud and waste, end support of 'woke' science, and align research with the administration's priorities. But the process has been unsettling for young scientists like <a href=\"https://wayne.edu/people/eu8282\" target=\"_blank\">Clara Zundel</a>, a postdoctoral researcher at Wayne State University in Detroit. Zundel, who studies how pollution affects the developing brain, currently has funding from the National Institutes of Health. But consideration of an NIH grant that would extend her funding has been delayed, she says. As a result, she decided not to spend the money to attend this year's neuroscience meeting. Instead, she's focusing on finding a job in an increasingly tight market. \"Many universities are still on partial or even full hiring freezes,\" Zundel says. \"So it's just made it really scary to think how I'm going to take that next step.\" Zundel isn't ready to abandon her career plans just yet. \"I absolutely love what I do, and I want to continue doing what I do,\" she says. Still. \"Talk to me in another three months,\" she says, \"and I might change my mind.\" Other young researchers are even less certain, Morrison says. \"You hear things like, 'I've prepared my whole life for this. Is it gone now? Is it no longer possible to be the scientist that I always wanted to be?'\" he says. \"Many will just choose something else.\" Others may take their research to another country. And if funding cuts and uncertainty persist, Morrison says, the field of neuroscience could lose a whole generation of scientists. <h3>Congress funds, White House cuts<strong>  </strong></h3> The NIH often awards five-year grants, and scientists tend to structure their research around that timeline. But in recent months, many grants have been paused or prematurely terminated. \"If you disrupt the grant in the middle, the work you've already done [may be] worthless,\" Morrison says. He also challenges the administration's claim that it is saving taxpayers' money. In the long run, he says, the human and financial costs of cutting research will be huge. Take Alzheimer's. Research into the neurodegenerative disorder costs the federal government a few billion dollars per year, Morrison says. But caring for people with the disease costs far more — hundreds of billions of dollars a year. And that cost, he says, will continue to rise until researchers find better treatments or a way to prevent the disease. Morrison says it's an excellent example of a principle expressed by the late <a href=\"https://laskerfoundation.org/about-us/mission/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Mary Lasker</u></a>, a philanthropist and champion of medical research, who famously said: \"If you think research is expensive, try disease.\" That sentiment is one reason brain science has long enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, says <a href=\"https://carney.brown.edu/people/diane-lipscombe\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Diane Lipscombe</u></a>, a professor at Brown University and chair of the government and public affairs committee at the Society for Neuroscience. Another is that, ever since World War II, science has been a huge boost to the U.S. economy, she says. That's because publicly-funded research not only helps train future physicians and scientists, it leads to new drugs and medical devices, biotech companies that spin off from universities, and patents on vaccines, cancer treatments, and even gene-editing technology. \"I don't think we've ever talked with anyone in the [House] or Senate who disagreed with that,\" Lipscombe says. But the current round of cuts and disruptions have come from the executive branch, not Congress. So neuroscientists are taking their case directly to the public. The Society's website, for example, now includes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@sfnvideo/shorts\" target=\"_blank\"><u>links</u></a> to videos of scientists explaining the work they do and why it matters. Lipscombe thinks that message will be heard. So when she talks to young scientists asking for career advice, she tries to offer an optimistic message. \"You just have to stay with what you love because things will get better,\" she says. At least, that's the hope.",

    "title": "More liberals, people of color and LGBTQ Americans say they're buying guns out of fear",
    "text": "When Charles was growing up in the 1970s in Brooklyn, N.Y., his mother was so strict, she forbade toy guns of any kind, including squirt guns. \"I remember vividly, summertime, when my friends would have water gun fights and I couldn't participate,\" he recalls. He grew up and became a doctor, and these days, he heads to a shooting range in Maryland each week for target practice with his Smith & Wesson .380. Charles, who is Black, says he bought the handgun after the Trump administration did things that scared him, including arresting a foreign student who criticized her university's policy on Israel and handcuffing a U.S. senator who was forcibly removed from a Homeland Security news conference. \"What I'm talking about is protecting myself from a situation where there may be some kind of civil unrest,\" says Charles. Like most people who spoke with NPR for this story, he asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution. Charles says he worries that some of President Trump's supporters may feel emboldened someday to target minorities like him and his family. \"He could dispatch citizens or the government,\" Charles says. \"I'm not saying that's what's going to happen. What I'm saying is none of this is out of the question any longer.\" <h3>Changing face of American gun ownership</h3> For decades, the image of gun ownership in America was white, rural and Republican, but that's been changing, according to gun clubs, trainers, Second Amendment advocates and academic researchers. They say more liberals, people of color and LGBTQ folks have been buying guns for years and particularly since Trump's reelection in 2024. This story was based on more than 30 interviews. David Phillips is on the training team of the Liberal Gun Club, which has chapters in more than 30 states and provides a haven for liberals to train and learn about guns. He says club membership has grown from 2,700 in November to 4,500 today. Requests for training, he says, have quintupled. \"The concern is about the supporters of the right-wing who feel that they have been given permission to run roughshod at least, if not commit outright violence against people they don't like,\" Phillips says. Asked about these concerns, the White House dismissed NPR's reporting. \"Instead of covering Americans exercising their Second Amendment Right and trying to disingenuously blame President Trump, NPR should highlight the dangerous language from elected Democrats that has driven leftists to commit actual violence against Republicans – including the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. Jackson said stories like this one are why NPR no longer receives federal funding. \"That's something we can all celebrate,\" she added. Trump has also blamed what he calls \"the radical left\" for demonizing him and his supporters and inspiring political violence. But many liberals who spoke for this story say it's the other way around. They say the president<strong> </strong>dehumanizes others with his rhetoric. For instance, Trump has said undocumented immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" The president has also called his political opponents, \"radical left thugs that live like vermin.\" Despite White House claims to the contrary, there is ample anecdotal evidence that more people are buying guns because some of the administration's policies frighten them. <h3>\"Never seen a surge like this before\"</h3> \"As everyone knows, there has been a huge surge in fear and panic since the election,\" said Tom Nguyen, speaking on YouTube to his LA Progressive Shooters gun club just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration. Nguyen said the club's Pistol 101 classes were already booked out for nine months. \"I've never seen a surge like this before,\" said Thomas Boyer, spokesperson for the San Francisco Chapter of the Pink Pistols, whose motto is: \"Armed gays don't get bashed.\" Even traditional Second Amendment groups say more liberals are seeking gun training. \"It's definitely common knowledge at this point,\" said Taylor Rhodes, communications director for the National Association for Gun Rights. There's no way to measure just how many people are buying guns because the political environment scares them, but the phrase \"How do I buy a gun?\" spiked a number of times in the past year, according to Google Trends. Those spikes happened around the time of Trump's 2024 election, his inauguration, the first immigration enforcement blitz in January and the day when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C. This recent surge in liberals buying guns is the latest in a years-long trend. For instance, a University of Chicago study found that gun ownership by Democrats or Democrat-leaning people rose by 7 percentage points between 2010 and 2022. David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, says the events of 2020 and early 2021 – the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot – were particular drivers. \"We do know that in that year that new gun owners were disproportionately African American (and) disproportionately female,\" Yamane said. <h3>Only for self-protection</h3> Like the vast majority of gun owners, those who spoke to NPR said they would use the weapons only for self-protection and would not engage law enforcement. \"All the language that we use is absolutely not about rallying together to arm and go assault anyone,\" says MJ, a member of a liberal, self-defense group in the Midwest who asked NPR not to use his full name because he feared retribution. \"If anyone even talks like that, I or someone else would probably boot them out of the group.\" Bill Sack, director of legal operations with the Second Amendment Foundation, which challenges gun control legislation, says he's glad to see more liberals exercising their right to self-defense – but he isn't happy about why. \"Is it a good thing that people are scared?\" he says. \"No, of course not.\" Every new gun owner who spoke to NPR said they thought it was highly unlikely they would have to defend themselves because of civil unrest. But they also said that if they ever had to, they'd regret not having a gun. \"As a man, as a father, as a husband, how remiss and derelict would it be for me to not be prepared?\" says Charles, the Maryland doctor.",

    "title": "The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is over. Here's what you need to know",
    "text": "The government is back open. It was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5607812/government-shutdown-ends-updates\" target=\"_blank\">the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 43 days</a>. There are lots of questions about what this means, how we got here and where we go from here. Let's answer some: <strong>Why did it start?</strong> The Democratic base has been urging its leaders to show more fight. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught tremendous blowback in March for doing an about-face and going along with Republicans to keep the government open despite what the left saw as an odious spending bill. When the latest funding fight came up, Schumer this time showed a united front with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Arm in arm, they refused to go along with continuing to fund the government, and made the key issue extending health care subsidies, which, if not extended, would mean tens of millions of Americans would see their health care costs increased. <strong>How did it end?</strong> It ended without the health care extensions Democrats were fighting for. Eight moderate senators crossed the aisle and indicated Sunday night that they had struck a deal with Senate Republicans to reopen the government. The reason they didn't hold out longer, this group said, was because it was obvious President Trump and congressional Republicans weren't going to negotiate, and too many people were suffering. The Trump administration — correctly — gambled that enough Democrats would not be able to stomach the amount of pain the administration was willing to inflict on the 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and more than 3 million federal workers. <strong>So what does the bill do?</strong> The bill <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/12/g-s1-97607/house-vote-shutdown-end\" target=\"_blank\">passed by Congress and signed by Trump</a> funds the government until Jan. 30 with carveouts for SNAP, benefits targeted at women, infants and children, or WIC, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Congress. Those will all be funded until the end of September 2026. It notably also tries to rectify the firings and loss of pay to federal workers, although it's a leverage point the Trump administration could use again if the government were to shut down again after Jan. 30. There is also money for <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whats-in-the-senate-shutdown-deal\" target=\"_blank\">increased security</a> for members of Congress, executive branch officials, judges and Supreme Court justices. Several Republican members were outspoken about this after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. <strong>If the government is only funded until Jan. 30, does that mean there could be another shutdown soon?</strong> It's possible. It depends on a few things. What lessons do Democrats take out of the shutdown? Does the fire within the base subside some between now and then? And is there an actual vote on health care subsidies? <strong>OK, so what about those health care subsidies?</strong> It's not clear yet, but the lack of a negotiation on them likely means they will expire unless enough moderate Republicans, feeling pressure in their districts, cross over to strike a deal with Democrats — and that Republican leadership and Trump go along with it. But that seems highly improbable — and tens of millions of people would see their premiums go up. <strong>If that's the case, what was the point of the shutdown?</strong> That's a question a lot of people, especially those left of center, are asking. They see what moderate Democrats did as caving to Republicans. The reality is, though, the 8 moderate senators, who caucus with Democrats and took this deal, didn't want to see regular people feel more unnecessary pain — and they saw no hope for Republicans to compromise after what became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Democrats did accomplish something in this shutdown, though. They elevated the issue of health care, and if Republicans block the extension of subsidies, then they will likely own increased health care costs in voters' minds. <strong>What does this mean for federal workers and flight delays?</strong> Government workers will get back to work, and recent mass layoffs are to be reversed. Furloughed workers were missing paychecks. As far as airports, there are already signs of easing, but it will likely be several days or more until everything will get back to normal. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that more air traffic controllers are heading back to work, but in the very short term, flight reductions at some major airports will continue. <strong>Were there any surprises?</strong> Yes, there were a few. First, there's drama around a provision slipped in the bill that would allow senators to sue the Justice Department for $500,000 each, if they were subject to subpoenas or had their phone records accessed as a result of DOJ's Jan. 6 investigation. House Republicans pledged to pass a resolution repealing that provision, but there's no guarantee of that or that the Senate will go along. There was also a clash about hemp regulation between two Republican senators from the same state. The disagreement between Kentucky Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul <a href=\"https://www.lpm.org/news/2025-11-11/mcconnell-paul-clash-over-senate-provision-that-critics-say-will-destroy-us-hemp-industry\" target=\"_blank\">got pretty heated</a>. The bill also shines a light on <a href=\"https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ag_divbjes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">how hundreds of local projects are funded</a> — from the purchasing of equipment for a college in the Virgin Islands, the establishing of a veterinary doctorate program in Maryland, urban forest conservation in Texas and asbestos abatement in Alaska to funding for local hospitals, rural community facilities, youth centers, fire stations, and so, so much more. It's earmarks — funding not voted on or allocated through the formal appropriations process but tacked on in spending bills — that pay for all of these things. One day, there will be a vet that will say he or she got a degree from the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore — and it'll all be because of the funding deal to reopen the government. Ah, democracy. <strong>Is there a guarantee on a health care vote?</strong> No. The moderate Senate Democrats, who crossed over to open the government, thought so, but House Speaker Mike Johnson said shortly after the deal was reached that he wouldn't commit to a vote. Whether the vote happens or not, if health care subsidies are not extended, it will be because of Republicans — and that will mean they will own higher health care costs heading into an election year. <strong>What does this mean for the Epstein files?</strong> The end of the shutdown meant the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat, who won a special election in Arizona replacing her late father. That's key because she signed onto a discharge petition trying to compel the Justice Department to release the files associated with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and her support gave a majority to those who want to see them released. Johnson, who is close to Trump, has argued compelling the release is not necessary — though the president has made clear he does not want them released in full and his Justice Department has not taken public steps to do so. Even if it passes, though, it will largely likely be symbolic. The Senate is unlikely to get the required 60 votes. Trump would, of course, like it to fail in the House. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of three Republicans who have also signed the discharge petition, met in the White House Situation Room, apparently about Epstein. Boebert did not remove her name even after the meeting. The day the shutdown ended, more investigative materials were released from the House Oversight Committee, including a leak from committee Democrats pointing specifically to emails from Epstein's estate, showing Epstein implying that Trump knew about the girls. Any day Trump is talking about Epstein is not a good day for the White House. <strong>Who winds up with the political advantage out of the shutdown?</strong> Democrats really upset their base — again. Progressives continue to feel like they get rolled by party leaders. At the end of the day, though, Democrats are likely the ones who got the most out of the shutdown and will have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5604818/shutdown-deal-democrats-politics-midterm-election\" target=\"_blank\">the advantage in the midterm elections</a>. Consider that Democrats are coming off huge wins across the country earlier this month in the off-year elections. The central issue in those elections was affordability. And through the shutdown, they elevated the issue of health care. The party and its candidates will likely be able to campaign on both of those issues next year, and with Republicans in charge, that will help Democrats — if they can mend fences with their base, that is.",

Yet the bill to reopen the government was reliant upon Democratic lawmakers of both chambers who joined Republicans, exposing rifts within the Democratic Party. That political divide was clearly evident in Maine's congressional delegation — and the <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2025-11-13/angus-king-broke-ranks-to-help-end-the-government-shutdown-the-backlash-has-been-withering\" target=\"_blank\"><u>public's reaction to how they voted</u></a>. \"Well, Angus really hurt us in Maine,\" said Donna Doucette who, like many folks in Maine, refers to Sen. Angus King by his first name. King — an independent who caucuses with Democrats — was among eight minority party senators who negotiated a deal with Republicans to reopen government. Doucette was one of about two dozen protesters holding signs along a busy street in Waterville on a recent cold and blustery November afternoon. The protesters, many of whom are part of the local Indivisible chapter, were opposed to the deal <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/12/g-s1-97607/house-vote-shutdown-end\" target=\"_blank\"><u>ending the government shutdown</u></a>. \"I've supported him from the beginning and I think he sold us out. Especially when I'm retired, still dealing with cancer — I don't need that now. Nor does my husband, who is even older than me,\" she said. As part of the deal, Senate Republicans promised a future vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. But critics say they betrayed the Democratic cause by failing to secure an actual extension of the tax credits that roughly 20 million ACA users rely upon to lower their premiums. Without congressional action, the average premium is <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>expected to more than double</u></a> after December 31st. Some protesters brought signs calling King a coward. Cindy Burke said he caved. \"We held out for 40 days, I think, and I just feel that we got nothing from it,\" said Burke. \"And a promise to have a vote on the ACA, I don't believe that is going to happen. I don't trust the Republicans.\" <h3>A small delegation with a significant split </h3> Maine's four-person congressional delegation is one of the smallest in the country. Yet their <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2025-11-13/jared-golden-chellie-pingree-split-votes-on-bill-to-reopen-the-federal-government\" target=\"_blank\"><u>mixed votes on the bill </u></a>to reopen the government reflect the national divide over the fraught issue. Maine's Republican Sen. Susan Collins blamed the shutdown on Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Yet as chairwoman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Collins <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2025-11-10/sens-king-and-collins-help-to-negotiate-potential-deal-to-end-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\"><u>helped broker the compromise</u></a> that funds the government through January 30 and fully funds some agencies through September 30. Maine Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, supported extending the ACA subsidies but blasted his party's shutdown strategy. He cast one of his party's six House votes to end the shutdown. His fellow Maine Democrat, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, views the compromise as a \"capitulation,\" particularly after the Democratic victories nationwide during the Nov. 4 election. \"Many of us felt like there was a lot of momentum behind us,\" said Pingree. \"And the Republicans are feeling these concerns. They are losing court battles and they are getting the same calls that we are. We should move them to a decision, not the promise of a vote.\" Angus King said in an interview with Maine Public Radio earlier this week that he's surprised by the <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2025-11-13/angus-king-broke-ranks-to-help-end-the-government-shutdown-the-backlash-has-been-withering\" target=\"_blank\"><u>ferocity of the backlash</u></a>, although he understands the sentiment. \"I understand because millions of people in this country are gravely worried and angry and frankly scared about the future of their country because of what Donald Trump is doing,\" King said. \"I'm with them. I've been to the 'No Kings' rallies here in Maine.\" But King defended his decision, saying Republicans made clear they would not negotiate on the ACA until the government reopened. Government shutdowns rarely secure policy concessions for the minority party. Although he supports extending the subsidies, King said the shutdown harmed Americans — and empowered Trump. That's why King voted with Republicans more than a dozen times to avoid or end the shutdown. \"And I get it: people want some place to stand up and they felt this was it,\" King said. \"But it's backfiring in a sense that it is hurting a lot of people without getting what we want.\" <h3>Independents play a key role in upcoming elections</h3> It's unclear how shutdown partisanship will impact next year's elections in Maine — a state where <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/sos/sites/maine.gov.sos/files/content/assets/2025-02-06-20Reg-20--20Enr-20pdf-20-A-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>30 percent of voters</u></a> are independents. And Maine could play an outsized role in control of Congress after 2026. Golden isn't seeking reelection in a House district that Trump won twice, giving Republicans an opportunity to flip the seat. And the shutdown is already popping up in the heated Democratic primary to challenge Collins, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Republicans. Collins has not yet announced that she is running for reelection, although she is aggressively fundraising. \"I want to reiterate my call for Leader Schumer to step down,\" said Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, a Marine Corps veteran and oysterman whose anti-establishment message has drawn huge crowds, despite recent controversy over past online comments and a tattoo widely recognized as a Nazi symbol. Platner has said <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2025-10-21/senate-hopeful-graham-platner-under-scrutiny-for-skull-tattoo-associated-with-nazi-ss\" target=\"_blank\"><u>he didn't realize the connection</u></a> when he received the tattoo as a young infantryman and recently had it covered. Platner denounced the shutdown deal, blaming Schumer — who opposed the deal but couldn't keep his party unified against it. But he also took a not-so-subtle jab at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who was recruited by Schumer to run for the Senate. \"The governor has Chuck Schumer's phone number. She should give him a call and have a chat about that.\" For her part, Mills said this week that she strongly disagrees with the deal to end the shutdown. \"I appreciate Senator King's efforts here, but it's not going to work,\" Mills said on MSNBC. \"The mere promise of taking it up, putting it on the calendar, talking about it in December . . . Maine people can't wait.\" Back in Waterville, protest organizer Karen Heck said she's frustrated — with King, with her Democratic Party and with politicians, in general. \"I just think that most people are tired of a government that doesn't work for them,\" Heck said. \"Whether that's a schism in the Democratic Party or not, I think that this old system, the old system is not working for us. And a lot of people are angry about that.\" Heck added that she thinks people will demand a change — possibly starting in next year's primaries.",

Not much of anything, according to some of the right-wing influencers who have long been clamoring for the government to release <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/30/nx-s1-5407856/conspiracy-theorists-dan-bongino-epstein-fbi\" target=\"_blank\">more information</a> about Epstein and his crimes. \"To me, these are nothingburgers. If they're even real,\" pro-Trump podcaster Jon Herold said on his Badlands Media Rumble livestream on Wednesday. Herold gained an audience in the wake of the 2020 election after <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/news/devolution-qanon-patel-patriot/\" target=\"_blank\">spreading QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories</a>. His fellow Badlands Media personality, Brian Lupo, took a slightly different view on his own livestream this week. The emails didn't exactly say nothing, he claimed, but they show that Trump was informing on Epstein and his associate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5494553/epstein-maxwell-doj-interview-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, who is serving a 20-year prison term for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. (Epstein died by suicide while in jail during the first Trump administration.) \"My take on this is Epstein and Maxwell are trying to figure out who's a mole or a rat or an informant in their circle of friends,\" Lupo said, referring to an email in which Epstein called Trump a \"dog that didn't bark.\" (The White House has denied that Trump was an informant.) Epstein <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/09/08/1121525125/heres-why-conspiracy-theories-about-jeffrey-epstein-keep-flourishing\" target=\"_blank\">looms large</a> for many <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/01/06/1223212801/the-new-jeffrey-epstein-files-have-set-off-a-fresh-round-of-conspiracy-theories\" target=\"_blank\">conspiracy theorists</a>, including QAnon believers. He's seen as a prime example of the satanic cabal of pedophiles they believe are entrenched among the world's most powerful people. QAnon adherents think Donald Trump is destined to defeat that cabal. Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein were once friendly but fell out decades ago. He's denied any knowledge of Epstein's trafficking of underage girls. While one of the newly released emails suggests Trump did know about Epstein's behavior, some right-wing media figures say the new disclosures prove Trump did nothing wrong. \"They're claiming it's a hoax, they're claiming that the Democrats are cherry-picking the things that make Trump look the worst, and that these things prove that he didn't actually do anything wrong and that he's not a criminal and that he was actually gathering information for the FBI on Epstein,\" said Mike Rothschild, an independent journalist and author who has written extensively about conspiracy theories and QAnon. He said that is \"very different from the song they were singing for years before that, which is that if we just bring down the Epstein ring, all of the Democrats are going to go down with him.\" Many prominent Democrats are shown communicating with Epstein in the newly released emails. Still, another common thread on the right is that the release is a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/14/nx-s1-5608204/white-house-dismisses-release-of-epstein-documents-as-a-distraction-from-democrats\" target=\"_blank\">distraction</a> by Democrats. \"They think that the Epstein thing is something that is going to distract you from their failures, although the Epstein thing, all it's really doing is exposing more Democrat failures,\" Vince Coglianese, a radio host and the editorial director of the Daily Caller, said on his Rumble livestream on Thursday. That echoes President Trump's Truth Social posts accusing Democrats of using Epstein to deflect from fallout over the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/g-s1-97700/we-were-gone-far-too-long-house-members-reflect-on-longest-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">government shutdown</a>. On Friday, he called on the Justice Department to investigate Democrats mentioned in the emails. Attorney General <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1989411168067440722\" target=\"_blank\">Pam Bondi said</a> she was appointing a federal prosecutor to lead a probe. Meanwhile, some prominent influencers and conservative media outlets are essentially ignoring this week's release of documents. \"They already know that their fans are on board 100% with whatever Trump does,\" Rothschild said. \"There's nothing for them here.\" At the same time, the emails are fueling new speculation on both the right and the left as people race to interpret Epstein's often cryptic language. To Rothschild, that is a fool's errand. \"Jeffrey Epstein was, like, not the most trustworthy person…You're taking him at his word because you want to believe him when he says things that are either good about Trump or bad about Trump,\" he said. \"It's absolutely maddening circular discourse and it gets us absolutely nowhere.\" <em>NPR's Huo Jingnan contributed reporting to this story. </em>",

    "title": "At Trump's urging, Bondi says U.S. will investigate Epstein's ties to political foes",
    "text": "NEW YORK — Acceding to President Donald Trump's demands, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday that she has ordered a top federal prosecutor to investigate sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's ties to Trump political foes, including former President Bill Clinton. Bondi posted on X that she was assigning Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to lead the probe, capping an eventful week in which congressional Republicans released nearly 23,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate and House Democrats seized on emails mentioning Trump. Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years, didn't explain what supposed crimes he wanted the Justice Department to investigate. None of the men he mentioned in a social media post demanding the probe has been accused of sexual misconduct by any of Epstein's victims. Hours before Bondi's announcement, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would ask her, the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with Clinton and others, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman. Trump, calling the matter \"the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans,\" said the investigation should also include financial giant JPMorgan Chase, which provided banking services to Epstein, and \"many other people and institutions.\" \"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" the Republican president wrote, referring to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged Russian interference in Trump's 2016 election victory over Bill Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Asked later Friday whether he should be ordering up such investigations, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: \"I'm the chief law enforcement officer of the country. I'm allowed to do it.\" In a July memo regarding the Epstein investigation, the FBI said, \"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" The president's demand for an investigation — and Bondi's quick acquiescence — is the latest example of the erosion of the Justice Department's traditional independence from the White House since Trump took office. It is also an extraordinary attempt at deflection. For decades, Trump himself has been scrutinized for his closeness to Epstein — though like the people he now wants investigated, he has not been accused of sexual misconduct by Epstein's victims. <h3>None of Trump's proposed targets were accused of sex crimes</h3> A JPMorgan Chase spokesperson, Patricia Wexler, said the company regretted associating with Epstein \"but did not help him commit his heinous acts.\" \"The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,\" she said. The company agreed previously to pay millions of dollars to Epstein's victims, who had sued arguing that the bank ignored red flags about criminal activity. Clinton has acknowledged traveling on Epstein's private jet but has said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes. He also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein's known victims. Clinton's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña posted on X Friday: \"These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.\" Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, but was spared a long jail term when the U.S. attorney in Florida agreed not to prosecute him over allegations that he had paid many other children for sexual acts. After serving about a year in jail and a work release program, Epstein resumed his business and social life until federal prosecutors in New York revived the case in 2019. Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Summers and Hoffman had nothing to do with either case, but both were friendly with Epstein and exchanged emails with him. Those messages were among the documents released this week, along with other correspondence Epstein had with friends and business associates in the years before his death. Nothing in the messages suggested any wrongdoing on the men's part, other than associating with someone who had been accused of sex crimes against children. Summers, who served in Clinton's cabinet and is a former Harvard University president, previously said in a statement that he has \"great regrets in my life\" and that \"my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.\" On social media Friday night, Hoffman called for Trump to release all the Epstein files, saying they will show that \"the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander.\" He added, \"I was never a client of Epstein's and never had any engagement with him other than fundraising for MIT.\" Hoffman bankrolled writer E. Jean Carroll's sexual abuse and defamation lawsuit against Trump. After Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in 2019, Hoffman said he'd only had a few interactions with Epstein, all related to his fundraising for MIT's Media Lab. He nevertheless apologized, saying that \"by agreeing to participate in any fundraising activity where Epstein was present, I helped to repair his reputation and perpetuate injustice.\" Bondi, in her post, praised Clayton as \"one of the most capable and trusted prosecutors in the country\" and said the Justice Department \"will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people.\" Trump called Clayton \"a great man, a great attorney,\" though he said Bondi chose him for the job. Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term, took over in April as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York — the same office that indicted Epstein and won a sex trafficking conviction against Epstein's longtime confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 2021. <h3>Trump changes course on Epstein files</h3> Trump suggested while campaigning last year that he'd seek to open up the government's case files on Epstein, but changed course in recent months, blaming Democrats and painting the matter as a \"hoax\" amid questions about what knowledge he may have had about Epstein's yearslong exploitation of underage girls. On Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three Epstein email exchanges that referenced Trump, including one from 2019 in which Epstein said the president \"knew about the girls\" and asked Maxwell to stop. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of having \"selectively leaked emails\" to smear Trump. Soon after, Republicans on the committee disclosed a far bigger trove of Epstein's email correspondence, including messages he sent to longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon and to Britain's former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Andrew settled a lawsuit out of court with one of Epstein's victims, who said she had been paid to have sex with the prince. The House is speeding toward a vote next week to force the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein. \"I don't care about it, release or not,\" Trump said Friday. \"If you're going to do it, then you have to go into Epstein's friends,\" he added, naming Clinton and Hoffman. Still, he said: \"This is a Democrat hoax. And a couple, a few Republicans have gone along with it because they're weak and ineffective.",

    "text": "President Donald Trump has publicly called it quits with one of his most stalwart MAGA-world supporters, calling Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \"'Wacky' Marjorie\" and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in next year's midterms \"if the right person runs.\" The dismissal of Greene — once the epitome of \"Make America Great Again,\" sporting the signature red cap for President Joe Biden's 2024 State of the Union address and acting as a go-between for Trump and other Capitol Hill Republicans — appeared to be the final break in a dispute simmering for months, as Greene has seemingly moderated her political profile. The three-term U.S. House member has increasingly dissented from Republican leaders, attacking them during the just-ended federal government shutdown and saying they need a plan to help people who are losing subsidies to afford health insurance policies. Accusing the Georgia Republican of going \"Far Left,\" Trump wrote that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" adding, of Greene's purported irritation that he doesn't return her phone calls, \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\" In a response on X, Greene wrote Friday that Trump had \"attacked me and lied about me.\" She added a screenshot of a text she said she had sent the president earlier in the day about releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, which she said \"is what sent him over the edge.\" Greene called it \"astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" referencing next week's U.S. House vote over releasing the Epstein files. Writing that she had supported Trump \"with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" Greene added, \"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.\" Trump's post seemingly tied a bow of finality to fissures that widened following this month's off-cycle elections, in which voters in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races flocked to Democrats in large part over concerns about the cost of living. Last week, Greene told NBC News that \"watching the foreign leaders come to the White House through a revolving door is not helping Americans,\" saying that Trump needs to focus on high prices at home rather than his recent emphasis on foreign affairs. Trump responded by saying that Greene had \"lost her way.\" Asked about Greene's comments earlier Friday as he flew from Washington to Florida, Trump reiterated that he felt \"something happened to her over the last month or two,\" saying that, if he hadn't gone to China to meet leader Xi Jinping, there would have been negative ramifications for jobs in Georgia and elsewhere because China would have kept its curbs on magnet exports. Saying that people have been calling him, wanting to challenge Greene, Trump added, \"She's lost a wonderful conservative reputation.\" Greene's discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn't run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who feared she couldn't win. In June, she publicly sided with Tucker Carlson after Trump called the commentator \"kooky\" in a schism that emerged between MAGA and national security hardliners over possible U.S. efforts at regime change in Iran. That only intensified in July, when Greene said she wouldn't run for governor. Then, she attacked a political \"good ole boy\" system, alleging it was endangering Republican control of the state. Greene embarked on a charm offensive in recent weeks, with interviews and appearances in media aimed at people who aren't hardcore Trump supporters. Asked on comedian Tim Dillon's podcast if she wanted to run for president in 2028, Greene said in October, \"I hate politics so much\" and just wanted \"to fix problems\" — but didn't give a definitive answer. That climaxed with an appearance on Bill Maher's HBO show \"Real Time,\" followed days later by a Nov. 4 appearance on ABC's \"The View.\" Some observers began pronouncing Greene as reasonable as she trashed Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana for not calling Republicans back to Washington and coming up with a health care plan. \"I feel like I'm sitting next to a completely different Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" said \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin. \"Maybe you should become a Democrat, Marjorie,\" said co-host Joy Behar. \"I'm not a Democrat,\" Greene replied. \"I think both parties have failed.",

    "text": "Last month, during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States had offered to functionally loan Argentina $20 billion. Despite the sums involved, this bailout required no authorization from Congress, because of the loan's source: an obscure pool of money called the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The ESF is essentially the Treasury Department's private slush fund.  Its history goes all the way back to the Great Depression. But, in the 90 years since its creation, it has only been used one time at this scale to bailout an emerging economy: Mexico, in 1995. That case study contains some helpful lessons that can be used to make sense of Bessent's recent move. Will this new credit line to Argentina work out as well as it did the last time we tried it? Or will Argentina's economic troubles hamstring the Exchange Stabilization Fund forever? <a href=\"https://www.planetmoneybook.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pre-order the Planet Money book and get a free gift</em></a><em>. /  </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3HlREPz\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Subscribe to Planet Money+</em></a> <em>Listen free: </em><a href=\"http://n.pr/PM-digital\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3gTkQlR\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3Bkb17W\" target=\"_blank\"><em>the NPR app</em></a><em> or anywhere you get podcasts.</em> <a href=\"https://n.pr/3h92GwS\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3FqLuws\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3sGZdrq\" target=\"_blank\"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> / Our weekly </em><a href=\"https://n.pr/3zrFvUB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Newsletter</em></a><em>.</em> <em>This episode was hosted by Keith Romer and Erika Beras.

    "title": "Trump scraps tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruit in a push to lower prices",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Trump announced Friday that he was scrapping U.S. tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a broad swath of other commodities — a dramatic move that comes amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices. Trump has built his second term around imposing steep levies on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of encouraging domestic production and lifting the U.S. economy. His abrupt retreat from his signature tariff policy on so many staples key to the American diet is significant, and it comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue, resulting in big wins for Democrats in Virginia, New Jersey and other key races around the country. \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,\" Trump said aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida hours after the tariff announcement was made. Pressed on his tariffs helping to increase consumer prices, Trump acknowledged, \"I say they may, in some cases\" have that effect. \"But to a large extent they've been borne by other countries,\" the president added. Meanwhile, inflation — despite Trump's pronouncements that it has vanished since he took office in January — remains elevated, further increasing pressure on U.S. consumers. The Trump administration has insisted that its tariffs had helped fill government coffers and weren't a major factor in higher prices at grocery stores around the country. But Democrats were quick to paint Friday's move as an acknowledgement that Trump's policies were hurting American pocketbooks. \"President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,\" Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer said in a statement. \"After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters' fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a 'pivot to affordability.'\" <h3>Grocery bill worries</h3> Trump slapped tariffs on most countries around the globe in April. He and his administration still say that tariffs don't increase consumer prices, despite economic evidence to the contrary. Record-high beef prices have been a particular concern, and Trump had said he intended to take action to try and lower them. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, had been a factor. Trump signed an executive order that also removes tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and certain fertilizers. Some of the products covered aren't produced in the United States, meaning that tariffs meant to spur domestic production had little effect. But reducing the tariffs will still likely mean lower prices for U.S. consumers. The Food Industry Association, which represents retailers, producers and a variety of related industry firms and services, applauded Trump's move to provide \"swift tariff relief,\" noting that import U.S. taxes \"are an important factor\" in a \"complex mix\" of supply chain issues. \"President Trump's proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,\" the association said in a statement. In explaining the tariff reductions, the White House said Friday that some of the original levies Trump relished imposing on nearly every country on earth months ago were actually no longer necessary given the trade agreements he'd since hammered out with key U.S. trading partners. Indeed, Friday's announcement follows the Trump administration having reached framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina meant to increase the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, while also potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products produced there. During an interview that aired earlier in the week with Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel, Trump hinted that lower tariffs might be coming. \"Coffee, we're going to lower some tariffs,\" the president said then. \"We're going to have some coffee come in.\" <h3>Tariff checks?</h3> Despite pulling back on so many tariffs, Trump used his comments aboard Air Force One on Friday night to repeat his past assertions that his administration would use revenue the federal government has collected from import levies to fund $2,000 checks for many Americans. The president suggested such checks could be issued in 2026, but was vague on timing, saying only, \"Sometime during the year.\" Trump, however, also said federal tariff revenue might be used to pay down national debt — raising questions about how much federal funding would be needed to do both. Trump rejected suggestions that attempting direct payments to Americans could exacerbate inflation concerns — even as he suggested that similar checks offered during the coronavirus pandemic, and by previous administrations to stimulate the economy, had that very effect. \"This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up,\" Trump said. \"Everybody but the rich will get this. That's not made up. That's real money. That comes from other countries.\"<br>",

But four years after voting for leftwing former student leader <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/12/20/1065722951/leftist-millennial-wins-chiles-weekend-presidential-election\" target=\"_blank\">Gabriel Boric</a> to become the country's youngest ever president with a mandate to expand the welfare state in Chile, this race looks radically different. Security, immigration and unemployment are top of the agenda for voters. Three right-wing candidates are vying to join Communist Party politician Jeannette Jara, 51, the current frontrunner according to polls, in a likely runoff election to be held next month. <a href=\"https://x.com/jeannette_jara/status/1988705781664084072?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Jara</a>, who served as labour minister in Boric's government and is a former student and union leader, is promising to gradually introduce a minimum income of $780 per month, as well as cash transfers to workers, and subsidies for small businesses. She closed her campaign on Wednesday evening in an open square in a southern district of the capital, Santiago, where supermarket cashier Rosa Rivera watched Jara deliver her closing remarks alongside her husband from the back of the crowd. \"She doesn't promise things she can't achieve, which I think is a very responsible approach,\" she said. \"I believe she would be a good president for Chile.\" In the evening sunshine across town, 20-year-old medical student Alanis Ramírez explained why her vote was going to far-right Catholic father of nine <a href=\"https://x.com/joseantoniokast/status/1989076190368534770?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">José Antonio Kast</a>, before ducking into a cavernous concert venue to hear her candidate speak one final time before Sunday's vote. \"He knows what our country needs, and he has the experience to deliver it,\" she said. \"Chile needs an iron fist, because criminals have it too easy – I can't even go out in the street in my neighbourhood anymore because it's too dangerous.\" Inside the building, music blared and a handful of young people jumped up and down excitedly at the request of a DJ playing reggaeton, while lights strafed the crowd as it built up. When Kast finally spoke to the packed arena, his plans to tackle illegal migration, delivered to a backdrop of red, white and blue, the colours of Chile's flag, provided a spectacle with a distinctly Trumpian ring. Kast's hardline security and immigration policies have seen him praise El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, who has cracked down on gang violence in the Central American nation, and paint his potential administration as an \"emergency\" government. He is proposing to criminalize irregular migration, dig border ditches and build walls, and construct new high-security jails. President Boric has been lambasted by Chile's right wing, who blame his administration for disregarding security, which is perceived to have skyrocketed under his leadership. In October, 63% of Chilean respondents to an Ipsos survey said that their most pressing concern was crime – more even than respondents in Mexico or Colombia. But while homicides have dropped and Chile remains one of the safest countries in Latin America, violent crime rates have spiked for some specific offences such as kidnappings. Outflanking Kast even further to the right is 49-year-old YouTuber-turned libertarian congressman, <a href=\"https://x.com/iviavaria/status/1988809720850002222?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Johannes Kaiser</a>, who is running for the presidency for the first time. At his own campaign closing event on Wednesday, a baying crowd was whipped up by Kaiser's vitriolic anti-communism and attacks on progressive values. In the crowd, some souvenir sellers sold pin badges with anti-communist messages and even mock ID cards with dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet's image. He has said that if elected, he would close the border with Bolivia to halt illegal migration, reduce the number of ministries from 25 to nine, deport undocumented migrants and their children, and withdraw Chile from international climate treaties and the regional human rights court. In 2021 as a congressman-elect, Kaiser questioned whether women should have the right to vote, and has consistently attacked what he refers to as \"gender ideology.\" A fourth rightwing candidate, <a href=\"https://x.com/evelynmatthei/status/1989136428266319999?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Evelyn Matthei</a>, a long-term fixture on the traditional right wing of Chilean politics, has fallen precipitously in the polls as a more moderate alternative for the presidency. Matthei, like Kast and Kaiser, is of German descent. She even thanked Kaiser in German at the final televised debate a week before the election. Voting is mandatory in this election, meaning turnout will be significantly higher than in 2021. If no presidential candidate secures an absolute majority on Sunday, as is expected, the two leading contenders will head to a runoff on Dec. 14th. The new president will take office on March 11.<br>",

    "text": "KWIGILLINGOK, Alaska – When the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit this Alaska Native village last month, Ryan David was at home with his four children. They felt the house shake in the wind, then as floodwaters came, the building floated away. \"I yelled at my kids to get up and group up here, on the stairs, just in case we tip over,\" David said when he <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/2025-10-12/live-updates-a-major-storm-is-bringing-dangerous-flooding-and-hurricane-force-winds-to-western-alaska\" target=\"_blank\">talked with public broadcaster KYUK</a>. He and his children were still trapped inside. David says the home stopped floating when it hit a bridge. He talked with a KYUK reporter as he waited for rescuers to arrive. A month later, as villages across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta clean up from the storm and make repairs, hundreds of residents remain evacuated to cities such as Anchorage and Bethel. Now they face another loss. One of the few sources of local news and native language programming — public radio and television station KYUK — has lost federal funding that was <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/arts-culture-community-features/2025-07-16/proposed-public-media-cuts-will-hurt-rural-americans\" target=\"_blank\">up to 70% of its budget</a> and plans to make cuts in January. The station plans to severely cut staff and some programming as it tries to raise money to fill the budget gap. The broader public media landscape is also experiencing <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5469920/pbs-npr-funding-rescission\" target=\"_blank\">a loss of federal funding</a>, including at least some money for improving <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/28/nx-s1-5519337/public-media-emergency-alert-funding\" target=\"_blank\">emergency alert systems</a>, as human-caused climate change from burning fossil fuels is heating the planet and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/01/09/1147805696/climate-change-makes-heat-waves-storms-and-droughts-worse-climate-report-confirm\" target=\"_blank\">increasing risks from extreme weather</a>. <h3>In remote villages KYUK is \"crucial\"</h3> KYUK broadcasts out of a small tan building at the base of a tall tower in Bethel, Alaska — about 400 miles west of Anchorage. Bethel is a hub community for <a href=\"https://www.avcp.org/about-avcp/our-region/\" target=\"_blank\">56 tribes spread across 48 communities</a>. The station says its coverage area is about the size of Louisiana. KYUK has been on the air since 1971 and \"is a <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/history-and-mission\" target=\"_blank\">Native American initiated public broadcasting</a> joint licensee\" — that means it has both a public radio and television stations. It also has a <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/\" target=\"_blank\">digital news website</a> and serves a predominantly Yup'ik population of less than 30,000 people in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Many residents, especially elders, primarily speak the Yup'ik language Yugtun. \"It's very crucial to have that KYUK network,\" says Darrel John, a lifelong resident of Kwigillingok. He says the news in Yugtun is especially valuable. \"A lot of great advice we listen to from the elders… Any updates from any other communities — you know what to look out for — and the upcoming events.\" Each weekday, as <em>Morning Edition</em> ends, there's local news and the weather forecast in Yugtun. \"Weather is definitely one of the things that KYUK focuses on because it's life or death,\" says Sage Smiley, KYUK news director. In a place where there are few roads, residents sometimes drive on frozen rivers and need to know where it's safe to do that. \"Getting from community to community in a boat, on a snow machine, in a bush plane, the weather matters almost more than anything else,\" Smiley says. When it became clear the remnants of Typhoon Halong were headed toward the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Smiley says reporters started including that in their reports to warn residents. She says fall storms and even flooding are common in the region, but Halong was different from most. \"This storm took a track that was unexpected, hit south of where it was expected to and in an area that was less prepared for the storm to hit,\" Smiley says. \"I think all of those factors went into what made it so devastating.\" Three people in Kwigillingok died because of the storm. Nearly every building in the village was damaged. Overall <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/halong-kipnuk-kwigillingok-flood-evacuation-b741508b131c3a4944a814b0ca45ac6e\" target=\"_blank\">more than 1,600 people were displaced</a>, many of them evacuated in helicopters. Smiley also coaches the high school swim team and was at a meet in another city when the storm arrived. \"I was working remotely from a minivan with the swim team while the rest of the [news] team was working on the ground here,\" Smiley says in the news department studio in Bethel. \"And we had collaborators in Anchorage who were helping draft scripts and call communities to figure out what was happening.\" That's part of being a news director at a small station, but soon KYUK will try to report the news with a third less staff, because in January Smiley's position will be among those cut. <h3>KYUK loses funding and makes cuts</h3> KYUK was already navigating a loss in funding <a href=\"https://www.kcaw.org/2019/06/28/governors-veto-cuts-all-funding-for-alaskas-public-radio-tv-stations/\" target=\"_blank\">from the state of Alaska</a> when President Trump <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/public-broadcasting-defunding-pbs-npr-94708ffb8313d4811fa6ca199fe454ad\" target=\"_blank\">targeted public media and Congress eliminated funding</a> this summer. It was a big hit to the station's finances because federal funding has been up the bulk of its budget. The federal money essentially paid for employee salaries and benefits. \"It's a little over $1 million that we're receiving each year from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Our salaries and benefits in FY 25 [fiscal year 2025] was also a little over $1 million,\" says Kristin Hall, KYUK's general manager. The station had 10 full- time employees and 13 part-time or on-call workers, says Hall. \"Beginning in January, KYUK will transition to four full-time employees and ten part-time and on-call employees.\" In deciding where to make programming cuts, Hall says preserving Yup'ik language programs was a priority. A daily interview program, <a href=\"https://www.kyuk.org/podcast/coffee-at-kyuk\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Coffee at KYUK</em></a>, will lose three episodes a week in English, but keep its weekly Yugtun episode. The station's technical director's hours will be cut from 40 to 10 hours a week, something Hall says she's particularly concerned about because that person trouble shoots engineering problems and helps the station manage power outages. To bring in more revenue, Hall says the station is applying for grants, trying to sell more underwriting announcements and will hold two pledge drives each year instead of just one. The station also expects to receive one-time funding through a Trump administration promise to provide <a href=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/grant-program-tribal-radio-stations-will-start-october-rounds-says\" target=\"_blank\">$9.4 million for tribal broadcasting</a>. Hall says the station will re-evaluate in March 2026 whether the workload is sustainable for the smaller staff. So, more cuts could still come. \"My employment here was hanging on by a hair,\" says Sam Berlin, a long-time host of the Yugtun language talk show <em>Yuk to Yuk</em>. \"But the people, God bless them, they got together and we raised over $100,000 with our fundraiser.\" Just before Typhoon Halong hit the region, KYUK raised the money during its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/177eb5Ggxc/\" target=\"_blank\">fall fundraiser</a>. \"It was our most successful we have ever seen in the history of KYUK,\" Hall says. That helps, but doesn't fill the funding gap. Raising money in a region with fewer than 30,000 people and with a poverty rate that's <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/expertise-and-inequality-amid-environmental-crisis-a-view-from-the-yukonkuskokwim-delta/73B88207E0BF94FB955A9A100C9D8EAC#:~:text=The%20Y%2DK%20Delta%20encompasses,essential%20role%20in%20Yup%E2%80%99ik%20culture.\" target=\"_blank\">twice the national average</a> is difficult. Hall says many people live a subsistence lifestyle, which means they may not have money to give. \"The encouragement that we get from local folks aren't always in dollars,\" Hall says. She says one person baked blueberry muffins to support the fundraiser and someone else dropped off salmon strips. Hall says an elder came to the station, and in an act of generosity, poured out her purse on the break room table. \"And everything that fell out was less than $3. And she said, 'I want you to have it.' And it was literally everything in her purse.\" Hall says the station hopes its funding strategy will be enough to support the smaller team after January. If KYUK doesn't exist, there's no one else doing the station's level of journalism in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. \"In terms of local news and information, and especially local news and information in Yup'ik, No, there is no one else,\" Hall says. <em>Disclosure: This story was written and reported by NPR Climate Correspondent Jeff Brady.

    "title": "Judge says he'll approve opioid settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue and Sackler family",
    "text": "NEW YORK — A federal bankruptcy court judge on Friday said he will approve OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma's latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic. The deal overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane would require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years. The new agreement replaces one the U.S. Supreme Court rejected last year, finding it would have improperly protected members of the family against future lawsuits. The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday. It's among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies. It could close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including from heroin and illicit fentanyl. Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in U.S. history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars. Purdue lawyer Marshall Huebner told the judge that he wishes he could \"conjure up $40 trillion or $100 trillion to compensate those who have suffered unfathomable loss.\" But without that possibility, he said: \"The plan is entirely lawful, does the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest available timeframe.\" <h3>The opposition is much quieter this time around</h3> The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits. This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote. Unlike with other proceedings, there were no protests outside the courthouse. A handful of objectors spoke during the three-day hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing. A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough. \"The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,\" Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video. <h3>Deal would be among the biggest opioid settlements</h3> A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago. Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis. There's no mechanism for tracking where it all goes or overarching requirement to evaluate whether the spending is effective. Those hit the hardest generally haven't had a say. Besides contributing cash, members of the Sackler family would formally give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing. The company would get a name change — to Knoa Pharma — and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. That could happen in the spring of 2026. Family members would be barred from involvement in companies that sell opioids anywhere in the world. And they would not have their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities. Company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public. <h3>Some people hurt by Purdue's opioids would receive some money</h3> Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue's products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal. All of money for the individual victims would be delivered next year. About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue's opioids and will receive nothing. Assuming about half of the individual claimants would qualify, lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000, before legal fees that would reduce what people actually receive. One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder. \"Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can't do anything with it,\" asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York. Christopher Shore, a lawyer representing a group of individual victims, said in court Friday that the settlement is a better deal than taking on Sackler family members in court. \"Some Sacklers are bad people,\" he said, \"but the reality is that sometimes bad people win in litigation.\" Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.",

It's not used as a political tool to increase your majority, it's to adjust for population changes.\" Other Republican-led states — like <a href=\"https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2025-10-28/missouri-republicans-redrawing-congressional-lines-redistricting-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Missouri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/21/nx-s1-5577000/north-carolina-redistricting-trump\" target=\"_blank\">North Carolina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2025/08/21/529188/texas-and-california-near-new-partisan-voting-maps-in-a-battle-prompted-by-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">Texas</a> — have heeded Trump's call for new congressional maps boosting the GOP. Last week, California voters <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5587742/election-results-california-proposition-50-redistricting\" target=\"_blank\">approved new districts</a> favoring Democrats. But Kansas' false start was just one example of lawmakers pushing back against a new round of partisan gerrymanders. On Friday afternoon, Indiana's state Senate president <a href=\"https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/indiana-senate-rejects-trump-call-for-redistricting\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> there wasn't enough support for redistricting among the chamber's Republicans. Democrats in Maryland have faced scorn from party leaders for speaking out against proposed redraws. And in Ohio, where many expected Republicans to enact a severe gerrymander, <a href=\"https://www.wosu.org/2025-11-05/why-democrats-struck-a-deal-with-republicans-on-an-ohio-congressional-map\" target=\"_blank\">a bipartisan deal</a> resulted in a map that moderately advantaged the GOP. <h3>Why do some lawmakers oppose redistricting that would help their party?</h3> Lawmakers' reasons for bucking their party leaders appear to vary widely, including those who object to gerrymandering on philosophical grounds — and some who simply fear the maneuvers could backfire. \"The particulars might be a little idiosyncratic to every state,\" said Patrick Miller, a political science professor at Kent State University in Ohio. Miller said some states, like New York and Colorado, have filing deadlines for congressional candidates that place an impossibly short timeline on potential redistricting efforts, given the steps needed in the states to craft a new map. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Kansas and Indiana raised eyebrows at the six-figure sums required to pay legislators outside of a regular session. Republican leaders in Kansas also faced a unique challenge. The state GOP would need to marshal nearly the full strength of its supermajorities in the state House and Senate to override a veto from the Democratic governor. Overall, Miller said, opposition to redistricting has not necessarily come from a place of righteous objection to gerrymandering. \"I'm sure that there are some Republican legislators out there who are opposed to Trump, who are principled about … redistricting,\" Miller said. \"But I don't see this as a pushback on Trump at all.\" Kansas state Rep. Clark Sanders said gerrymandering is a \"fact of life\" in politics. But he opposed hastily redrawing Kansas' 3rd District — held by the state's lone Democrat in Congress, Sharice Davids — because he thought it could backfire on Republicans. \"If we weren't careful, we might end up redistricting and making it difficult to also win in the 2nd District,\" he said. Sanders said he expressed the same concern when he received a call from the White House several weeks ago, to talk about redistricting. Last week, Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins stripped Sanders of a leadership position for refusing to sign off on a special session. He was one of seven committee chairs and vice chairs who were demoted for failing to toe the party line on redistricting. \"It's unfortunate that we lost our positions,\" Sanders said. \"We just … felt like we needed to do what we needed to do.\" Similar objections have sparked infighting in other states. Maryland's state Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, has stood in opposition to his governor by publicly opposing redistricting. Ferguson <a href=\"https://x.com/SenBillFerg/status/1985104464441655432\" target=\"_blank\">has argued</a> a legal challenge could place redistricting in the hands of the conservative-leaning state Supreme Court — resulting in new maps that hurt Democrats, rather than giving them a leg up. <h3>\"Ready to ride\"</h3> Despite those setbacks, redistricting proponents in several states are still trying to convince holdouts — under the watchful eyes of the national parties. Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore <a href=\"https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/governor-moore-announces-redistricting-advisory-commission-to-recommend-new-congressional-maps.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">recently formed</a> a redistricting advisory commission, despite state Sen. Ferguson's pushback.  And Kansas Republican leaders have <a href=\"https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2025-11-05/kansas-republicans-fail-to-get-support-for-redistricting-but-their-plan-isnt-dead-yet\" target=\"_blank\">vowed to put maps before lawmakers</a> when their regular session begins in January. \"I learned a long time ago that when you get thrown by the bull, you dust yourself off and you climb back on,\" House Speaker Hawkins wrote in a newsletter after his chamber rejected a special session. When lawmakers return to Topeka early next year, he said, \"House Republicans will be ready to ride.\" Even some holdouts in Kansas, like Republican state Rep. Adam Smith, said they had not ruled out the possibility of voting to redistrict in the future. \"If there's another map that's drawn that looks a little bit more representative for my folks, I'd probably seriously consider voting for that,\" he said.",

    "title": "New book collects essays of Jacob Geller, prolific YouTube cultural critic focused on games and art",
    "text": "If you’re looking for timely cultural criticism, you might more easily find it on YouTube than through a digital or print article. “When I was first writing blogs, the only people that would see those blogs were people who were already following me for some reason,” said writer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/JacobGeller\">Jacob Geller</a>. But since becoming a video essayist, YouTube’s algorithm has allowed him to “break containment,” as he puts it. While Geller notes that there are many negative aspects to such algorithmic recommendations, it has allowed him to reach millions of viewers. “Something that is kind of amazing about it is it has allowed me to make these things that seem incredibly specific and then find that actually a lot of people have the same niche, specific interests as I do,” said Geller. Geller collected the transcripts of some of his videos into a new book entitled “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Game-Lives-Jacob-Geller/dp/006348319X\">How a Game Lives</a>,” out Nov. 19. He took the opportunity to update these essays with extensive annotations. He also commissioned contributions from other writers, such as novelist Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah. “I always want an essay of mine to kind of open a potential avenue for analyzing something that someone hadn&#8217;t thought of,” said Geller. “Each essay that I&#8217;ve written now has a new afterword by a different author that is responding to the themes of the essay.” Geller sees his work as continuing to an ongoing conversation about art, drawing from literature, film, TV and — most characteristically — video games. “Games are kind of the point zero that I build from,” said Geller. “Most games have a narrative of some sort and sometimes that&#8217;s just communicated through dialogue between characters,” he said. “But also games have mechanics. They have specific ways that they make you interact with the world. You&#8217;re having to make decisions in a way that you can&#8217;t do in a book. And it makes it really interesting to analyze.” <h3>5 questions for Jacob Geller</h3> <strong>You’ve explored the military shooter franchise “Call of Duty” several times. You are interested in the meaning of violence in games. Why?</strong> “Most games involve violence in some way. It is kind of the main verb that players often do, whether it&#8217;s shooting or slashing with a sword. And for a long time, us in the video game discussion sphere have been kind of scared of talking about it because violence was used to condemn video games. You know, now, and especially in the ‘90s and early 2000s, shootings were connected to the perpetrators being gamers. Because of that, it became almost the third rail that we didn&#8217;t want to talk about in the chance that someone used it to then say, ‘This is why video games shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to be made.’ “But I think that we can&#8217;t ignore that ‘Call of Duty,’ which is routinely the best-selling game of the year, is an incredibly violent series, specifically, a militarily propagandistic series. Not just that it&#8217;s convincing players to shoot people virtually, but that it is imparting all sorts of ideas of what the role of the American military is, which I find much more frightening than the idea that video games might somehow just cause a player to become violent in real life.” <strong>When you take one of these big topics, how long does it take to make one of your videos? </strong> “It takes quite a long time. Playing a game in itself is often not a short experience. A movie might be two hours long. A game could be 50 hours long. More and more, as I have gotten into researching these topics, I will play a game and then read multiple books on the subject. “I made a video about the ‘Call of Duty’ series ‘Use of Torture,’ and that included reading several, you know, textbooks essentially about torture and how it is used in different places. And so I would say, usually it is at least two months on kind of a rolling schedule of playing, thinking about, researching, writing, editing. I&#8217;m often working on multiple videos at once because YouTube likes for you to have a kind of release schedule.” <strong>We&#8217;re talking to you because you have a paper book out. So why come back to the ancient technology of the physical book?</strong> “It does seem like a regression, right? To go from the amazing sparkly world of YouTube to books. One of the overwhelming feelings I have working on the internet was when the internet started, we kind of talked about it as, ‘Oh my gosh, the internet is forever. Anything that goes there will stay there for all time.’ “That is not the case. You know, websites can change their content guidelines, they can shut down, they can make themselves unsearchable from AI tools or algorithms that are not conducive to people finding what they&#8217;re looking at. “And especially in the world of games writing, so many websites have gone bankrupt and all of their archives have just disappeared. So I have really found an appeal in owning physical things, whether that&#8217;s vinyl of the music I love or books of things that are even available in other places. And so by kind of making this book, I was like, I can archive my work and I can also make it more beautiful. I can include art. I can go back and look at the ways that my thoughts have changed. But it really is this feeling of anything digital slipping through our fingers if we&#8217;re not actively trying to preserve it.” <strong>Your book is called “How a Game Lives,” and you&#8217;ve noticed that there are many ways a game, like a video, can die. It can be delisted by a store online. A once-popular online game can vanish from servers overnight. How do you hope your work here can preserve in this age when things come and go?</strong> “I think some of the most important records of art that we have is how people respond to it at the time. You know, it&#8217;s wonderful to see a painting, but it&#8217;s even more wonderful to understand what that painting meant when it was released — what people&#8217;s reactions were to impressionism or to cubism or anything. “And games are very much the same way. Modern games are built on the back of old games. It&#8217;s a very iterative medium. But if we aren&#8217;t able to remember what people were talking about when those first things came out, then we end up just kind of having the same conversations over and over. And so what I really want to preserve is this idea that people have always been talking about games as art and treating games as art. And if we can remember that, then we can move forward in the way that we think about them and analyze them.” <strong>Is there a current or previous generation of cultural commentator you return to a lot? </strong> “My favorite writer is Robert MacFarlane, who&#8217;s a nature writer. He&#8217;s written the book ‘Underland.’ ‘Is A River Alive’ is his new book. He explores caves, rivers, oceans, seas. But the thing that I love about him is that he just seems to have read everything and talked to everyone. “So he is able to make these incredible connections between the environment and storytelling and history in a way that is mind-bogglingly connected. And that is the very high bar that I have set for myself. I would like to do that with games, stringing out that web of connections to show everything that they&#8217;re related to.” <em>This interview was edited for clarity. </em>____ <em><a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/james-perkins\">James Perkins-Mastromarino</a> and produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/todd-mundt\">Todd Mundt</a>.

In 1975, Byrne, along with bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, founded <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15321830/talking-heads\" target=\"_blank\">Talking Heads</a> — a band that was a trailblazer in the new wave scene and went on to release several highly influential albums.

    "title": "Scientists pull ancient RNA from a woolly mammoth's body",
    "text": "It was 2012 when <a href=\"https://palaeogenetics.com/people/36-2/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Love Dalén</u></a>, a paleogeneticist at Stockholm University, first laid eyes upon a special specimen on a lab table in eastern Siberia. \"Our Russian collaborators said, 'Come here into this room,'\" he recalls. \"We walked in and there's this dead mammoth lying there. It doesn't look like it died yesterday, but you can't believe your eyes because it's so well preserved. It's a kind of holy hell moment when you see this.\" The animal had been found thawing out of a permafrost cliff near the Siberian coastline — not quite the entire body of a juvenile mammoth that lived during the last Ice Age some 39,000 years ago. It had remained buried and frozen for millennia. Now, in a paper published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01231-0\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cell</em></a>, Dalén and his colleagues report that they managed to extract something remarkable from that ancient mammoth — RNA, the molecule that translates genes into proteins and which tends to degrade rapidly. The results offer a glimpse into what was happening inside this ancient mammoth's cells when it died. <h3>The molecules that maketh a mammoth</h3> The Russians named the animal — which they believed to be a female based on visual inspection — Yuka. \"It does have deep scratch marks on its hindquarters,\" says Dalén. \"It either was attacked by cave lions while it was alive, probably chasing it down, or maybe cave lions were scavenging on it after it had died.\" Over the years, various researchers had studied and sequenced Yuka's DNA, \"which is kind of a recipe for how to make a mammoth,\" explains Dalén. (That DNA contains genes, which carry instructions for building specific proteins.) But he and his collaborators wondered about the mammoth's <em>RNA</em> — the flurry of little messenger molecules that translate that recipe into the building and operating of an actual mammoth. \"The RNA molecules instruct the cells how and when to make proteins,\" says Dalén. Most every cell in an organism's body has the same DNA. And yet — depending on where they are and what they do in the body — those cells can look and behave differently from one another. \"What makes these cells different is the RNA activity in them, which genes are turned on and off,\" he says. \"That is what separates liver cells from muscle cells and so on.\" \"The whole set of RNAs contained in a cell at a given time point is very much dynamic [and] can also quickly change in response to many factors, like stress, daytime, feeding, sleep, contaminants, infections, etc,\" says <a href=\"https://palaeogenetics.com/ems/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Emilio Mármol Sánchez</u></a>, a geneticist at the Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics at the University of Copenhagen. Dalén, Sánchez, and their team figured that if they could get RNA out of that ancient mammoth, they'd have a snapshot of the genes that were in use around the moment when it died. The only problem was that RNA doesn't usually hang around for very long. RNA tends to survive mere minutes or hours — generally not millennia. \"It felt like a very high-risk project,\" says Dalén. \"It seemed like a completely crazy thing to try to do.\" Still, there have been a smattering of studies that have turned up ancient RNA. \"So we knew that there was a chance, if we had some really well-preserved samples, to get this to work,\" he says. <h3>RNA reveal party</h3> Dalén and his colleagues collected tissue samples from ten different mammoths, including Yuka, and painstakingly worked to extract RNA. The resulting fragments were all very short, either because they were small to begin with or because, despite being frozen, they had broken down with time. Then came the challenging task of piecing those segments together, validating that they really were mammoth RNA. \"The big bulk of the work is on the computational side to make sense of all these gigabytes of data,\" says Dalén. On the other end of that analysis was something unmistakable, he says — woolly mammoth RNA. Most of it was too fragmented to know what it was or where it came from, but three of the mammoths had sufficient material to analyze. That included Yuka, whose muscle had been sampled. The resulting RNA was related to slow-twitch muscle function and development. That was a reassuring confirmation but not surprising. The team also found RNA that would have been produced in response to some kind of stress. \"That would be consistent with an animal being chased down by cave lions, but of course there could also be other explanations,\" says Dalén. \"If you get stuck in mud, your muscles would be stressed out from trying to get out. So we can say that the muscles were stressed at the point of death, but we don't really know why.\" In addition, some of Yuka's RNA came from a Y chromosome. A closer look at the animal's DNA confirmed it had one X and one Y chromosome. \"Genetically, Yuka was definitely a male,\" says Dalén. \"In theory, Yuka could have developed as a female. But more likely those critical morphological parts were missing when they did the visual inspection, let's put it that way.\" All told, Dalén says the results are a stunning proof of principle — that it's possible to know which genes were active in a now-extinct animal. \"You're actually seeing processes going on inside the cells right around the time it died,\" he says. \"And these processes have then been frozen in time for 40,000 years.\" <a href=\"https://hgen.uchicago.edu/faculty/maanasa-raghavan-phd\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Maanasa Raghavan</u></a>, a paleogeneticist at the University of Chicago who didn't participate in the research, notes that the samples studied here were well-preserved and came from a fairly pristine environment. She's less certain whether the same techniques could be applied to specimens collected in temperate and tropical areas that are richly biodiverse but where preservation tends to be worse. Still, Raghavan called the work \"fabulous in terms of all sorts of technological barriers being shattered.\" She says future work with RNA in these and other mammoth specimens may offer insights into what drove the species to extinction. <a href=\"https://liigh.unam.mx/mavila/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>María Ávila Arcos</u></a>, an evolutionary genomicist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who wasn't involved in the study, says the approach provides a new layer of insight into a species that vanished long ago. \"Having this information adds to our understanding how these creatures lived and how they adapted to their environment,\" she says. She's excited by the results — and not just for mammoths. She says they point the way to the potential study of ancient RNA viruses. \"A lot of very important pathogens like Ebola, COVID, influenza — they have RNA genomes,\" says Ávila Arcos. \"They mutate so rapidly. But if we want to understand their evolution or how these viruses have impacted populations in the past, we need to be able to recover the genetic material, which is RNA, from ancient samples.\" In other words, Yuka's RNA has opened a window for us to consider its past, while allowing scientists to dream about all the discoveries that lie ahead.",

    "title": "'The Running Man,' a new 'Now You See Me,' and George Clooney are in theaters",
    "text": "There's yet another <em>Now You See Me</em> in theaters this weekend, along with yet another Stephen King adaptation. George Clooney plays a charming Hollywood star in Jay Kelly, while a warm, funny and goosebump-raising documentary streams on Apple TV. Here's what to watch. <h3><strong>Now You See Me, Now You Don't</strong></h3> <em>In theaters Friday </em> The cast keeps expanding in this magic-centric rob-from-the-rich-give-to-the-poor heist franchise, as if the writers saw <em>Ocean's Eleven </em>through <em>Thirteen</em> and thought, \"we could do that.\" New kids Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa and Ariana Greenblatt join original Horsemen (and hangers-on) Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman and Isla Fisher in pursuit of a priceless diamond held by a money-laundering arms dealer (Rosamund Pike). That fits the aesthetic of the first two <em>Now You See Me'</em>s (shouldn't this one really be called <em>Now You Three Me</em>?) — but where the earlier films seemed to want you to believe the on-screen magicians were pulling off their tricks, this one mostly settles for CGI and cinematic trickery, so that even card tricks fall slightly flat. Eisenberg's prickly snark is still fun, but with the tricks getting less convincing and the scripts more exhausting, it might be time for this franchise to go up in a puff of smoke. <em>— Bob Mondello </em> <h3><strong>The Running Man </strong></h3> <em>In theaters Friday </em> <em>This trailer includes instances of vulgar language. </em> One tricky thing about writing dystopian fiction with staying power is that the future eventually catches up with you. Stephen King's 1982 novel <em>The Running Man </em>takes place in 2025. In his vision of, well, now, there is widespread poverty, rule by giant corporations, and exploitative entertainment that takes advantage of people who are suffering and tries to force ordinary people to despise each other. There is environmental destruction, mass surveillance, and even the resurgence of polio. Just imagine. The story follows a man named Ben Richards, who tries to provide for his family and his sick kid by going on a game show also called <em>The Running Man</em>. On the show, he has to survive on the streets for 30 days while professional assassins pursue him. If he makes it, he wins a billion dollars. But, of course, nobody has ever survived. In the new adaptation, directed by Edgar Wright, Richards (played by Glen Powell) auditions for the game shows run by the megacorporation known as The Network because his daughter has the flu, and Richards and his wife can't afford a doctor for her without a big prize. The biggest problem with this adaptation is that if you read the book, you probably know there are a couple of things about the ending that a major studio movie released in 2025 is unlikely to replicate. As an action movie that hits the gas, gets the running man running, and doesn't let up, it works quite well, and it's a lot of fun. But some of King's sharper-elbowed commentary about what it might take to escape this kind of oppressive society is blunted a bit, making it a less effective critique of its world than the book was. <em>— Linda Holmes </em> <h3><strong>Jay Kelly</strong></h3> <em>In limited theaters Friday; on Netflix Dec. 5</em> Hollywood star Jay Kelly — handsome, affable, debonaire, sixty-something … in short, George Clooney — reconsiders his life choices on a trip to Tuscany in Noah Baumbach's bland mid-life crisis dramedy. Estranged from one daughter (Riley Keough), and distressed by the growing distance of another (Grace Edwards) who's off on a trip to Europe before college, he's feeling alone in a crowd of paid companions, including his faithful manager (Adam Sandler, excellent) and publicist (Laura Dern, whose talents are mostly wasted). After a public altercation with a college buddy, he opts to avoid the PR blowup and possibly find some catch-up time with his daughter by taking an impromptu trip to Italy for a career tribute he'd previously turned down.  Minor misadventures ensue — a train trip punctuated by a purse snatching incident, a reunion with his coarse dad (Stacy Keach), a fight with his increasingly put-upon manager. Not sure I was feeling anyone's pain about the loneliness of stardom, the heartbreak of success, the … whatever the hell else this was about. Baumbach has wandered into the territory of <em>8½ </em>and<em> Stardust Memories</em> and he gets a bit lost in the woods, but Clooney's magnetism goes a decent way to making things palatable, the cinematography is pretty and Sandler dominates whenever he's on screen. <em>— Bob Mondello </em> <h3><strong>The Things You Kill</strong></h3> <em>In limited theaters Friday </em> Iranian-Canadian director Alireza Khatami's Turkish-language thriller follows Ali, a university professor, as his life unravels. His mother's sick, his father's a bully, his wife wants a child (he hasn't told her his sperm count is low), and his only safe place is an arid farm (\"garden\") to which he retreats whenever possible. The arrival of Reza, a stranger who is game to do the things Ali won't (bribe bureaucrats to deepen his well, maybe even kill his father) complicates things, and also, in a sense, solves them. The filmmaker's first name provides a not-insignificant clue as to what's going on, as his filmmaking deconstructs the story and his protagonist in initially confusing, and then riveting ways. <em>— Bob Mondello</em> <h3><strong>Come See Me In the Good Light</strong></h3> <em>Streaming on Apple TV starting Friday</em> There's no way to make this documentary sound like the upbeat, rousing and often downright hilarious romp it is, but here goes: At the urging of comedian Tig Notaro, poet and spoken-word star Andrea Gibson and life partner and fellow poet Megan Falley invited filmmaker Ryan White and his crew into their home in 2021. It was mid-pandemic, and the crew was allowed full access to the couple's every thought and action as they dealt with turtledove love, mailbox madness, and – here's the part where you say, \"no, this does not sound like a good time\" — Gibson's Stage 4 ovarian cancer journey. At the Middleburg Film Festival screening I attended in October — three months after Gibson's death — the director spoke beforehand, giving the audience \"permission to laugh,\" which it definitely did. It also sniffled a bit, but less than you might expect, because Gibson's vibrant, assertively affirmative outlook doesn't really brook tears, and the filmmaker's warmth and humor, even in times of despair, gives the story a radiance that makes mundane moments feel precious, while allowing hopeful moments to raise goosebumps. <em>— Bob Mondello </em><br>",

    "text": "The Arabic word <em>sirāt</em> means \"path\" or \"way\"; in Islamic scripture, it refers to a narrow bridge that connects Paradise and Hell. That makes it a fitting title for the director Oliver Laxe's new movie, which is both exhilarating and devastating.  <em>Sirāt</em> is a survival story about several unlikely traveling companions making their way through a godforsaken stretch of the Sahara Desert. It carries echoes of countless earlier films, from the arid landscapes of a John Ford Western to the post-apocalyptic setting of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/02/08/465989808/mad-max-director-george-miller-the-audience-tells-you-what-your-film-is\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mad Max</em></a>. But nothing about <em>Sirāt</em> feels derivative or secondhand. It's an astonishing piece of cinema; I haven't had a more gripping experience in a movie theater all year. It begins somewhere in southern Morocco, where hundreds of nomadic European revelers have gathered for a rave. It seems that World War III or something like it has broken out, though the specifics are left vague. Whatever's going on, <em>Sirāt </em>initially plays like a party at the end of the world: Imagine a remake of the recent dystopian thriller <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/12/1244092650/civil-war-review-kirsten-dunst\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Civil War</em></a> set at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/17/nx-s1-5075310/burning-man-slow-ticket-sales\" target=\"_blank\">Burning Man</a>, and you'll have some idea. Laxe, a French-born, Spanish director, sweeps you up in the intense physicality of the dancing and the propulsive beat of the music, composed by the experimental electronic musician Kangding Ray. Wandering around this unruly desert bacchanal is a middle-aged man named Luis, played by the Spanish actor Sergi López. This clearly isn't Luis' scene. Along with his young son Esteban and their dog, Luis is searching for his 20-something daughter, Mar, who vanished months ago, and whom he has reason to suspect is among the ravers.  But she's nowhere to be found, and before long, armed officials show up and, invoking a state of emergency, break up the party. Amid the ensuing chaos, five ravers drive off, bound for another rave further south. Luis and Esteban impulsively drive after them, hoping against hope that they'll find Mar. In Laxe's previous films, including the 2016 drama <em>Mimosas</em>, which also chronicled a perilous journey through Morocco, he has worked mainly with non-professional actors. With the exception of López, that's also true here. The director recruited most of the principal cast from raves that he himself attended, and they're all naturals. I especially liked Stefania Gadda as a woman of few words but immense screen presence, and Jade Oukid as a dancer of mesmerizing ability. You feel for these off-the-grid daredevils, and you admire their survival tactics during what will prove to be an exceedingly dangerous trek. While the ravers have an enormous truck and a camper van, Luis and Esteban are in a small van that's ill-equipped for the treacherous terrain. But the ravers, somewhat reluctantly at first, let them tag along. They all share their limited resources, including food, water and gas. And they help each other out, when Luis has trouble fording a small river, or when the truck gets stuck on a steep mountain road.  <em>Sirāt</em> is a visually and sonically overwhelming experience; it's full of majestic desert vistas and propelled by that thrillingly percussive score. It's also a drama of extraordinary tension and, eventually, shocking tragedy, in which death has a way of striking when you least expect it. I was often reminded of <em>The Wages of Fear</em> and <em>Sorcerer</em>, two classic nail-biters, both adapted from a Georges Arnaud novel about a road trip from hell. What separates <em>Sirāt</em> from those two films, though, is its lack of cynicism. López is terrific as a father whose child has disappeared and who's understandably wary and mistrustful of the world. But even at his bleakest moments, Luis receives unexpected acts of compassion from his new companions.  At one point, Esteban asks one of the ravers if he misses his family, while traveling on the road, and the raver responds, \"I prefer this family.\" That might sound like something Vin Diesel would say in a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/10/1175235412/why-the-fast-and-furious-franchise-is-still-speeding\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fast and Furious</em></a> movie, and as it happens, Diesel's driving skills might have come in handy here. But Laxe's film is as sincere in its tenderness as it is unrelenting in its ferocity. There's something powerful about the movie's belief that, even as an apocalypse looms, kindness can survive and meaningful relationships can form. Just because the world is pitiless, <em>Sirāt</em> suggests, doesn't mean that people have to be.<br>",

    "title": "The Trump administration plans major shift away from long-term housing for homelessness",
    "text": "The Trump administration is upending its homelessness policy, with deep cuts to funding for long-term housing. Instead, it will shift money toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment. In a statement, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said <a href=\"https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/360861\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the new policies</u></a> will \"restore accountability\" and promote \"self-sufficiency\" by addressing the \"root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.\" It also noted that overall homelessness funding is going up, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. <h3>170,000 people could be at risk of losing their housing </h3> Critics warn the major overhaul could put 170,000 people at risk of losing their housing again. And they say the timing is terrible. Normally, funding notices go out months earlier, but now programs around the country will have little time to start applying for new funding. And in many places, it will leave a months-long gap after current funding runs out and before new money flows. \"We'll move very, very fast,\" said HUD policy expert Robert Marbut, in response to such concerns. He also noted the federal shutdown delayed the funding notice, though homelessness advocates say it was already behind schedule before that. In another change, HUD will no longer automatically renew existing programs – creating the possibility that formerly homeless people who've lived in subsidized housing for years will be forced out. In fact, Marbut said the agency expects some programs to no longer receive funding because it will go to others instead. The agency also says it's opening up more funding for faith-based groups. The National Alliance to End Homelessness says the new policies could upend life for people who've found stability in permanent housing programs, many of them seniors or disabled. \"HUD's new funding priorities slam the door on them, their providers, and their communities. Make no mistake: homelessness will only increase because of this reckless and irresponsible decision,\" CEO Ann Oliva said in a statement. The new policies could also shift more funding to places that enforce bans on homeless encampments. \"Donald Trump's approach to homelessness does nothing to address the sky-high cost of rent, which remains the main cause of homelessness,\" Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement. <h3>The funding shift reflects a conservative backlash to longstanding policies</h3> For two decades, federal funding has prioritized getting people into permanent housing and then offering them treatment. That policy is called Housing First and has long had bipartisan support. Backers say the approach has a proven track record of keeping people off the streets. But critics counter that it has failed to stem the steady rise of homelessness to what are now historic levels. Those critics include President Trump, who has long pushed cities to clear homeless encampments from streets and parks. The new funding shift reflects an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/nx-s1-5479139/trump-homelessness-executive-order-civil-commitment-camping\" target=\"_blank\"><u>executive order he signed in July</u></a>, which also sought to make it easier to confine unhoused people in mental institutions against their will. Marbut, the HUD policy expert, also said Housing First policies have failed to address rising death rates among unhoused people from meth and fentanyl addiction. \"The influence of Housing First just became too powerful,\" says Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank. He calls it a top-down approach, and says for years it was hard to get funding unless a program followed that policy. Eide says that left out a large group of people who may not need permanent housing or who may want the enforced sobriety it does not offer. \"I think what we're going to be looking for is a reinvestment in transitional housing,\" he says. That means places people can stay for 18 months or so to get sober, or recover in other ways, and then — ideally — move out and succeed on their own. There's broad agreement that the U.S. needs more of every kind of support for homeless people: permanent housing, rehab and mental illness treatment. But critics of HUD's shift fear this may make it harder for some to get help. \"It is moving away from trauma-informed care, and that's problematic,\" says Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, president and CEO of LA Family Housing in Los Angeles. For example, she thinks this will lead more shelters to bar people unless they're already sober or enrolled in recovery or mental health care. But that's a high bar for many people, she says, and it could backfire.",

    "title": "She criticized President Trump during the shutdown. Now she's been put on leave",
    "text": "Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institutes of Health, says she has been put on paid leave following the end of the government shutdown. \"I was not given a reason for being put on leave, but I strongly suspect it is because I have been speaking up in my personal capacity about the harms that I have been witnessing inside the National Institutes of Health,\" she said in <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jennajmn/video/7572341483563388190?_r=1&_t=ZP-91NSHQq4Huh\" target=\"_blank\">a video posted to TikTok</a>. The notice Norton received from human resources stated that the leave \"is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.\" She is among a number of federal employees who have been openly critical of the Trump administration, both before and during the 43-day shutdown. Norton first spoke out in June, when she helped organize <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5425466/nih-research-freedom-bethesda-declaration\">a call to action by hundreds of NIH scientists</a>, pushing back against cuts and changes at the agency. They warned the Trump administration was politicizing research and canceling studies, putting the health of participants at risk. In <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/07/nx-s1-5563872/government-shutdown-federal-workers-layoffs-rifs\">an interview with NPR in early October</a>, Norton said she believed the Trump administration's deep funding and staffing cuts have created a situation inside NIH that is far worse than the public realizes. \"I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy,\" she said. \"We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public.\" The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not respond to NPR's questions about why Norton was placed on leave and instead issued a statement calling her a \"radical leftist\" who \"chooses to constantly criticize this administration, even when she is supposed to be working.\" Norton responded on TikTok, saying \"If it is radically leftist to believe that NIH policies should not be actively harming research participants, then I will wear the radical left label proudly.\" <h3>Agriculture Department employee also on leave</h3> On Thursday, the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of former and current federal workers and union members, announced that an Agriculture Department employee who worked on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had also been put on leave. Ellen Mei, who also serves as president of National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) Chapter 255, received a notice of proposed termination on Oct. 3, a day after she raised concerns about food assistance programs in an interview on MSNBC, according to the Federal Unionists Network.  \"I didn't leak secrets or share anything confidential,\" said Mei in a statement released by the group. \"I told the truth about what's happening to hungry families and the people who serve them. I took an oath to serve the public — not to stay quiet while our government turns its back on the American people.\" In a statement, a spokesperson for USDA told NPR that the department does not comment on individual personnel matters, adding: \"During a lapse in appropriations, furloughed USDA employees are not authorized to perform any official duties, including speaking on behalf of the Department.\" MSNBC prefaced Mei's interview by stating that she was not representing the government, but speaking in her own capacity. <h3>A right to speak on matters of public concern</h3> Norton says she believes federal workers not only have a right but an obligation to speak publicly on matters of the public interest. She points to a <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep391/usrep391563/usrep391563.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">1968 Supreme Court decision</a> that found public employees can speak on matters of public concern as long as the speech doesn't disrupt government operations. She knows federal employees also have whistleblower rights. \"Allowing civil servants to put up a red flag when we're seeing a problem is critical to maintaining our democracy,\" she told NPR in October. \"These civil service protections aren't really about protecting me as a federal worker. They're about protecting our country.\" Still, on Friday, Norton told NPR she knew she was putting her job at risk by speaking out. \"I was never under the impression that my rights would be respected,\" she said. \"I also recognized… that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid or because you're demoralized or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up. You've let them be taken away. And I was determined not to do that.\" <em>NPR's Rob Stein contributed to this story.</em>",

Republican strategist Alex Conant says the documents may not necessarily change people's minds for the next election, but it makes for a not-so-good week for the president. <ul><li>🎧 <strong>Conant says that the White House should have handled the Epstein story differently</strong> by releasing all the information they had. The White House claims it has been transparent about the situation, but at the same time, Trump doesn't want to answer questions about Epstein, NPR's Deepa Shivaram tells <em>Up First</em>. Conant points out that Trump's strategy is to deflect, attack and then change the story, but due to the slow drip of the Epstein story, it has been <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5608919:nx-s1-mx-5806772\" target=\"_blank\">harder for the president to overcome this scandal</a>.</li></ul> <strong>The Trump administration has selected Charlotte, N.C., as the next city for its immigration crackdown</strong>, according to Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden. The sheriff said yesterday that federal officials contacted him and <a href=\"https://www.wfae.org/crime-justice/2025-11-13/mecklenburg-sheriff-says-border-patrol-agents-are-heading-to-charlotte\" target=\"_blank\">could arrive as early as tomorrow</a>.

The suspect was not an immigrant, but Republicans and the White House criticized the city's Democratic mayor for the crime. Violent crime is down 20% over the last year, according to de la Canal, but there have still been calls for the National Guard to deploy to the area. It is currently unknown how many agents are expected to arrive in the city, and the <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5608919:nx-s1-mx-5806772\" target=\"_blank\">community has been reacting with fear</a> to the news, despite advocacy groups urging calm.</li></ul> <strong>Trump will soon travel across the U.S. to address the economic hardship Americans are feeling</strong>, a senior administration official told NPR. Trump's message will be that, while some things have improved, there is still more work to be done. This comes as the president revives the talking point of making America affordable again — a pledge that helped him win the White House again but that has not been much of a focus the past eight months.

    "title": "BBC apologizes for edit of Trump speech but says it won't provide legal compensation",
    "text": "LONDON — Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC, has issued a personal apology to President Trump over a misleading edit of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech in a documentary broadcast on its <em>Panorama</em> series. But the BBC has firmly rejected a demand from Trump's legal team for compensation. His personal attorneys <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/10/nx-s1-5604710/president-trump-has-threatened-to-sue-the-bbc\" target=\"_blank\">threatened a $1 billion defamation lawsuit</a> unless the BBC retracts the program, apologizes and pays for causing him to \"suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm.\" In a letter to the White House released late Thursday, BBC Chair Samir Shah said he and the corporation were \"sorry for the edit of the President's speech,\" acknowledging that the way the footage was spliced created \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\" But despite the apology, the letter made clear it does not concede the defamation claim. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the corporation said.  The documentary — titled <em>Trump: A Second Chance?</em> — was commissioned by the BBC from an external production company and aired shortly before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together separate parts of Trump's speech on the day of the Capitol riots, even though the excerpts came from moments almost an hour apart. Critics argued that the edit misrepresented the president's words, especially by omitting a section where he had called for peaceful protest.  <h3><strong>Swift, public consequences</strong></h3> In its retraction, the BBC accepted that the editing \"unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech … and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\" The broadcaster also announced it had no plans to rebroadcast the episode. The legal threat from an incumbent U.S. president has triggered serious fallout at the BBC. Director-General Tim Davie and CEO of BBC News Deborah Turness both <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/09/nx-s1-5603609/bbc-director-resigns-after-criticism-of-the-broadcasters-editing-of-a-trump-speech\" target=\"_blank\">resigned in the wake of the controversy</a>. In a message to staff, Davie admitted \"we did make a mistake and there was an editorial breach,\" but also urged them to defend the BBC's journalism under growing pressure. The British government has also been drawn into the debate. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy defended the broadcaster in Parliament this week, highlighting its importance at a time of political polarization and widespread misinformation.  \"It is by far the most widely used and trusted source of news in the United Kingdom,\" she told fellow lawmakers. \"At a time when the lines are being dangerously blurred between fact and opinion, news and polemic, the BBC stands apart.\" <h3><strong>A legally complex case</strong></h3> The president's lawyers have threatened to file suit in Florida, but legal experts note that it could be difficult for Trump to argue reputational damage in the U.S. since the documentary did not air in the country widely, so it may be challenging to prove Americans watched and were influenced by the film. Still, the dispute has stirred a broader debate about the BBC's role and accountability.  Critics fear that, if forced to pay out, the BBC could be using public funds to settle with a foreign head of state.  For many in the United Kingdom, this touches on national pride and the public broadcaster's mission to inform and educate, not to be dragged into costly legal battles. If the case proceeds, it could cost millions in legal fees, even if the BBC ultimately wins, and media lawyers say the public nature of pretrial disclosures could have a huge cost to the broadcaster's reputation. <h3><strong>Opposition from the British public</strong></h3> Established over a century ago and operating under a Royal Charter, the BBC is funded almost entirely through a TV license fee that is paid by most U.K. households.  Its reporting has shaped the national understanding and perception of wars, elections, royal events and major cultural moments, meaning the lawsuit has touched a cultural nerve for many Britons.  That was sharply articulated during a BBC radio phone-in earlier this week.  One caller, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cd9kqz1yyxkt?post=asset%3A73c28427-e12f-4de3-9238-409ba21a470e#post\" target=\"_blank\">identifying himself only as Simon</a> from the southwest town of Truro, warned he would not support public funds reimbursing the former U.S. president.  \"If we have to pay a penny to Trump, then I'm sorry — I'm not going to pay my TV license,\" he said. \"The world just seems to be frightened of him. I think the BBC needs to stand up to him.\" Media analysts say this reaction reflects how entwined the BBC is with British national identity. \"The idea that an American president would sue the British broadcaster, paid for by British taxpayers — sue for a billion dollars for a 12-second edit of a speech he made is pretty astonishing,\" says Jane Martinson, a columnist for the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper and journalism professor at London's City University. Martinson also says Trump's latest threat repeated a pattern of trying to exploit existing dissatisfaction — in this case that stems from the BBC's coverage of other issues, like Gaza, gender rights and British politics.  \"It's about sowing dissent on the very nature of accuracy and impartiality.\" <h3><strong>A broadcasting giant</strong></h3> Stewart Purvis, a former CEO of major news network ITN and once an official at the U.K.'s media regulator, said the BBC plays a role unmatched elsewhere.  \"The BBC is the most consumed broadcast media outlet in the U.K. It's almost like combining two or even three of the American networks,\" Purvis told NPR.  \"You know, everybody loves the BBC in some way, but everyone has something to complain about, about the BBC.",

    "text": "In real life, it's hard to imagine that a stranger would decide to harass <a href=\"https://pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/cameron-corhen/14460\" target=\"_blank\">Cam Corhen</a>. Corhen is 21 years old and 6 feet, 10 inches tall. He's got 235 pounds of muscle draped across his broad frame. And he's a Division I college athlete: a forward for the Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball team, averaging 15 points per game. On the internet, though, none of that stops people. The harassment of athletes on social media has <a href=\"https://www.ncaa.org/news/2024/10/10/media-center-ncaa-calls-on-fans-social-media-platforms-to-curb-abuse-as-it-releases-first-online-harassment-study.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">become an epidemic</a>, an experience so common that players today accept it as a fact of life. College basketball players are more at risk than athletes in other sports, the NCAA has found, especially <a href=\"https://www.ncaa.org/news/2025/6/10/media-center-ncaa-releases-2025-march-madness-signify-data.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">around March Madness</a>, when thousands of abusive or threatening messages flood athletes, many of them from gamblers — some of it so severe and alarmingly specific that the NCAA must alert law enforcement. The toll it takes, players say, has become difficult to bear. Fighting through tears after his Wildcats lost last March to end a disappointing season, Kansas State's Coleman Hawkins said the online criticism had gotten to him. \"I did a poor job of letting people talk about me and affect my play,\" he said, sobbing. \"I wish I could just go back and block out everything.\" When the name, image and likeness door was thrown open for college athletes, social media promised to be a cash cow. Build a personal brand with a following on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/24/nx-s1-4978680/house-ncaa-settlement-pay-college-athletes\" target=\"_blank\">lucrative sponsorship deals</a> would soon come rolling in. But as harassment and threats have grown, players (and coaches, too) have begun to ask themselves: Are the business opportunities worth the harassment? Increasingly, they have decided the answer is no. \"At the end of the day, we are human beings. We have feelings,\" said Indiana's Oumar Ballo after the Hoosiers lost in last year's Big Ten tournament, which sealed their fate of being left out of March Madness. Imagine, he said, \"you wake up, go to work, and someone is wishing nothing but the worst to you and your work. It's mentally draining.\" \"If you're not cheering for us, then leave us alone,\" he added. <h3>Online abuse is getting far worse</h3> Corhen's eyes opened to the problem during his sophomore year, when he still played for Florida State University. In a November 2023 game against Colorado, he hurt his toe and had to leave the game early. The Seminoles won in overtime, but Corhen scored only two points. Afterward, he got on the team bus and looked at his phone for the first time in hours. On his home screen were a series of unsettling DMs. \"I messed somebody's parlay up, I guess, and I got some crazy messages,\" Corhen said. One said, \"I hope your mom dies,\" he recalled. At the time, Corhen was just 19 years old, barely a year removed from leaving home. It rattled him. He struggled to shake it off. Nearly everybody in big-time college sports has this story now. To be launched from the anonymity of high school into the brightly-lit world of Division I college sports — with a media landscape that stretches from TV to news sites to podcasts to social media — is a wild ride. Having a social media presence is effectively compulsory. \"As an athlete, you want to be out there. You want people to know your name,\" said SMU guard Kyla Deck. \"It can maximize the money you're making. It can maximize the stage you're putting yourself on.\" To help their athletes build those brands, big-time athletic departments now employ staff dedicated to an assembly line of \"creative content\" for players to post — highlight packages, interviews, game footage shot by in-house camera crews perched on the sidelines specifically for social media highlight reels. Players often supplement those posts with stylist-approved fashion shots. All this, of course, is to make money. Starting in 2021, when a U.S. Supreme Court decision forced the NCAA's hand in allowing student-athletes to earn income from licensing their name, image and likeness, or NIL, college athletes have regularly netted tens of thousands of dollars (or more) from sponsored social media posts and other marketing partnerships. Even athletes with modest numbers of followers can earn money this way: Baylor's Bella Fontleroy (6,000 Instagram followers) <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQKUz8MD1Nt/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">recently hawked TLF Apparel sweatsuits</a>. UCLA's Gianna Kneepkens (4,500 followers) has ads for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/giannakneepkens/p/DHTxQmfpEka/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Celsius energy drinks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/babystar_usa/p/DFqkprSKfcX/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">the Japanese snack company Baby Star</a> on her feed. The St. John's forward Zuby Ejiofor (7,600 followers) <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C41mVYOrkjM/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">posted for Bose</a>. Houston's Emanuel Sharp (12,000 followers) <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C4HmhYlLfX9/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">did a post for the fast food chain Freddy's</a>. Like the rest, Corhen began his career that way. But open Corhen's Instagram now, though, and you'll see nothing. No posts at all. Back in 2023, Corhen returned from his toe injury after a month, but struggled to live up to his potential that season, averaging just 9.4 points per game. Looking for a fresh start, he transferred to Pitt. Still, he struggled with his mental health, he said, and the criticism online made it worse. The public tweets are hostile enough. (A typical example: In January, after Corhen managed just two points in an 82-70 loss against Florida State, one X user wrote \"f*** you point shaving bum @cameroncorhen.\") \"After a game, it would pop up on the front page of my phone, what people arej saying if they tagged me,\" he said. \"And it's just, like — I don't need that.\" The DMs, of course, were worse. \"Mind you, these are people with burner accounts, so you don't know who they are. You don't know their identity,\" he said. \"And you lost their money, so they say really hurtful things.\" This summer, almost two seasons after the gambler wished death on his mom, the Pitt forward decided to delete it all. \"I couldn't get over that hump last year. So instead of trying to find ways to deal with it, I just cut it out completely,\" he said. <h3>Coaches, too, question what it adds</h3> When Corhen raised questions about the value of social media amid harassment, his coach, Jeff Capel, understood. In Capel's first few years at Pitt, the team struggled, and the online criticism was loud, he recalled — loud enough to seep into his home life. \"My kids are seeing stuff at home, my children. I'm seeing the stuff, it's affecting me,\" he said. \"I made the decision then that I don't need this, I don't want this, I can't do this anymore. So I just completely pulled away.\" Now, he must coach his players through those decisions, too. \"The thing that I tell them is that the main way in basketball that you can make money is to be a good basketball player,\" Capel said. \"So if social media is causing you to be emotional, or to not be in the right mind state, or to react a certain way, or whatever — then I think you should really think about removing it.\" For female athletes, there's an added pressure: a feeling of responsibility for helping to build the audience for the sport as a whole. The ongoing surge of interest in women's sports was sparked by college basketball players like Iowa's Caitlin Clark and LSU's Angel Reese, who were already social media stars while they were still in school. \"Without social media would we still be where we are now as a sport, as women's basketball players?\" said Hannah Hidalgo, the Notre Dame guard and a favorite to win player of the year awards. Before Brooke Wyckoff became the coach at Florida State, she played there in the late 1990s then spent nine years in the WNBA. It was a very different time for women's basketball. \"Nobody even was paying attention if I performed poorly,\" she said. \"There was no social media. In the newspaper the next day, it might show up this big,\" she joked, holding her index finger and thumb an inch apart. Now, her staff at FSU includes a creative content team, and her team's off-court obligations include regular photo and video shoots, which are also now part of the recruiting process. Wyckoff says she has spent a lot of time debating whether the time and effort spent on social media content are worthwhile. She still hasn't reached a conclusion. \"It's what you have to do these days. It's standard operating procedure,\" she said. \"But it doesn't help us put points on the board.\" But what's not up for debate, she added, is that schools cannot provide players with social media content without also teaching them how to use the platforms responsibly. \"As we are encouraging them and providing them content so that they can build their brand, we also have a responsibility to educate them and to help them set up boundaries that are going to protect their mental health, or protect them in general,\" Wyckoff said. <h3>Finding a way to be \"regular\" </h3> Even those with social media accounts have long since wised up to the risks of posting anything too personal. \"Everybody's watching you, and haters are watching, too,\" said Deck of SMU. \"They want to go to your social media to find something to say about you. So just don't give anybody anything room to say.\" Deck raised the example of Ja Morant, the NBA star who was suspended twice in 2023 after waving a handgun on two separate Instagram Live streams. In total, Morant missed 33 games and lost millions of dollars in salary. (This fall, while livestreaming on Twitch, Morant said, \"I don't even like IG no more, man. IG changed my life.\") Last spring, Notre Dame's Hidalgo ignited an online furor when she reposted a video of the conservative commentator Candace Owens calling gay marriage a sin. Afterward, Hidalgo apologized in a letter <a href=\"https://www.theplayerstribune.com/hannah-hidalgo-notre-dame-basketball-ncaa\" target=\"_blank\">published by the Players' Tribune</a>. \"I've always been very private, and learning how to navigate the media in public as a young person is just plain hard,\" she wrote. Even after that, it's still a shock to see how much she is talked about and scrutinized, both for what she does on the court and what she does off it, she told NPR last month. \"It's like a rock and a hard place,\" she said. \"I'm regular. I'm typical. I just put a ball in a hoop every couple of days.\" Now, one upside of the end of an athlete's career may be that their time on social media can end, too. Reniya Kelly of the University of North Carolina is one of the nation's top point guards — and a self-professed social media hater. \"You guys will never see me on TikTok unless I'm forced to literally do it or someone pays me,\" she said. \"I think it takes away the fun of the game. There's a lot of pressure and outside noise that comes in with social media.\" She already has a vision for her retirement from basketball. \"I want to be a farmer. I love land. I love fishing. I love having my own crops. I want to live off my own land,\" she says. Kelly is a junior now, with a chance at a career in the WNBA. After that, there'll be nothing stopping her from going off the grid.",

    "title": "Dear Life Kit: I'm tall. How do I politely ask people to stop bringing it up?",
    "text": "<strong>Dear Life Kit <em>is NPR's advice column, where experts answer tricky questions about relationships, social etiquette, work culture and more. Have a question you want to ask Dear Life Kit anonymously? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/07/15/1016029627/advice-column-life-kit-ask-questions\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em><u>Share it here.</u></em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong> <em>These questions were answered by Adia Gooden, a clinical psychologist and host of the podcast </em><a href=\"https://dradiagooden.com/podcast\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Unconditionally Worthy</u></a>,<em> and NPR's Brittany Luse, host of </em> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510317/its-been-a-minute\" target=\"_blank\"><u>It's Been a Minute</u></a><em>. </em> <em>The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em> <strong>Dear Life Kit, I'm a six-foot-tall woman, and both complete strangers and new acquaintances often make comments like, 'Wow, you're tall.' Some people say I should take it as a compliment, but it makes me feel like a spectacle. I don't want to normalize the comments, but I also don't want to embarrass the commenters. How can I respond? — <em>More than my height</em> </strong> <strong>Brittany Luse:</strong> I appreciate the fact that you don't want to embarrass people. I want to offer the idea of maybe not 100% embarrassment or even 60% embarrassment, but a nice, gritty little 15% embarrassment. You can respond with, 'Oh my gosh, you're the first person to tell me that.' Give them a little giggle. Give them the opportunity to laugh with you, but they know you're not playing. And if they don't take the hint the first time, you can be direct. 'Is this catching your attention so much that you have to say something right now?' I think you can give someone one pass with a little joke to let them know you don't like it. And then after that, be really direct. <strong>Adia Gooden:</strong> I agree.  If people continue to cross this boundary, be more serious about it. You can say, 'It's not cool. I'm not comfortable with it. Please stop.' If somebody feels a little embarrassed and realizes they shouldn't have said that, that's OK. You're not saying they're an awful person, but you're communicating that what they did is problematic. They should feel a little taste of it so that they stop. <strong>Dear Life Kit, I've been with my boyfriend for seven years. I'm starting to feel pressure from family members and friends to settle down and have a wedding. We're planning to get married, but we want to wait until we are more financially secure. How can I let people know we're not in a hurry to get married without being rude? — <em>Not in a hurry</em></strong> <strong>Gooden:</strong> If people are coming from a loving place, just say, 'We're being really intentional about how we want to start the next chapter of our lives together. Weddings are expensive. We don't want to start our lives together in debt or going into debt.' <strong>Luse:  </strong>When I was in a similar situation, I would say, 'If you've got tens of thousands of dollars that you want to give me, go right ahead.' Or the other, mildly gentler, response, 'I don't have any updates to share right now, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.' Which is what I say now when people ask me about having children. <strong>Gooden:</strong> [If a lighter touch doesn't work,] you can just say, 'Please stop asking us. It's kind of frustrating when you keep asking us about our plans. We will be sure to let you know when we are going in that direction, but until then, please respect our decision-making.' <strong>Dear Life Kit, My future sister-in-law often says things that are hurtful or judgmental. She once told me, 'I love you, but you're too self-absorbed to own a dog.' And this was over a meal that I brought over for her. I've had pets, raised my younger sister and taken care of my sick mom. I don't think most people would consider me self-absorbed. Her comments bring my fiancé and me down. I've begun avoiding her. How can I cope in a healthy way and still have a relationship with her? — <em>Feeling frozen?</em></strong> <strong>Gooden:</strong> This might be a situation where you need to recognize when someone's comments are not about you. If you know that you're not self-absorbed, then you shouldn't let somebody's comment derail you or override what you know to be true about yourself. So, how do you stay grounded in who you are? You need to discern whose opinion you're going to take and whose opinion you're going to leave. If your wise grandma says, 'Hey, it seems like you've been focusing on yourself a little too much, and I want you to think about this.' That might be different than a comment from a sister-in-law who tends to make judgmental comments. She may be somebody whose opinion you're going to ignore. You may also need to set some boundaries. For example, 'Hey, I feel judged when you give me advice. So I prefer that not to be part of our relationship.' <strong>Luse:</strong> At the end of the day, this is your fiancé's sister, and I wonder if he could play a bigger role in managing your relationship with her as a couple. It sounds like maybe he's also feeling the impact of her judgment. I'll share something my therapist said to me once when I was navigating a difficult relationship: 'Have you ever considered that this person may never change? I want you to consider that, and then think about how you want to conduct yourself going forward.' You can't control her. You can only control how and when you interact with her, to a certain degree. <em>The podcast episode was hosted by Andee Tagle and produced by Sylvie Douglis.

    "title": "Economic promises helped Trump get elected. Now he has an affordability problem",
    "text": "President Trump says he is going to \"make America affordable again.\" It's a pledge he made frequently during the campaign. And now, after dropping it from his lexicon for more than eight months, he's saying it again as polls show voters rank the economy and cost of living as their top concern and <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26211915/cnn-poll-trump-midterms-east-wing-parties.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">blame Trump's policies</a> for making things worse. A senior administration official tells NPR Trump will soon travel around the country with a message that while some things have improved, there is more work to do to help people feeling economic strain. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, added that when it comes to affordability, \"there's no finish line.\" Thus far, Trump has spent far more time boasting about how great the economy and stock market are doing than acknowledging any economic anxiety. \"Record high, record high, record high,\" Trump said of the stock market last week at a business event in Florida. \"Costs are way down,\" Trump said at a late night signing ceremony in the Oval Office Wednesday. \"My administration and our partners in Congress will continue our work to lower the cost of living, restore public safety, grow our economy and make America affordable again for all Americans.\" Trump's affordability challenge marks a dramatic reversal of fortune for a president who returned to office on a promise to bring costs down and whose greatest political strength was on the economy. Now his approval rating on the economy is severely underwater. After sweeping wins by Democrats in last week's elections where the cost-of-living was a key issue, Trump suddenly had a lot to say about \"affordability.\" But he has frequently come across as dismissive and defensive. \"The affordability is much better with the Republicans,\" Trump said last week. \"The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads.\" But earlier this week when Fox News' Laura Ingraham pressed Trump on rising costs of things like coffee and ground beef, he called it a \"con job by the Democrats.\" Asked why people are anxious about the economy, Trump responded by questioning whether people really are saying that. \"I think polls are fake,\" Trump said. \"We have the greatest economy we've ever had.\" To support his positive outlook, Trump points to the booming stock market, his tariff policy and pledges by companies and countries to invest in the U.S. Inflation this year has been persistent but not dramatic, at about 3%. Eggs have gotten cheaper since Trump took office, but other staples like ground beef and coffee are up. According to <a href=\"https://x.com/GasBuddyGuy/status/1988974247310671898?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Gas Buddy</a>, the average price of gasoline in the U.S. is $3.09 per gallon, slightly higher than this time last year. \"Consumer confidence is the lowest it's ever been,\" said Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard. \"People are really negative about inflation.\" It's a political truth — and a pitfall for presidents — that people don't want to hear that everything is awesome if they are struggling. Furman, who served in the Obama administration, says the messaging team in that White House was very cautious not to brag about the economy, as the nation emerged from the Great Recession. \"Because they thought anything we said positive about the economy risked people thinking President Obama was out of touch,\" said Furman. \"I didn't see that type of reserve when Biden was president. He bragged about it quite a lot, and I think that [rang] hollow with a lot of people. And President Trump is even less reserved about his bragging.\" Trump's insistence that the economy is great earned him a rebuke from Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Appearing on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD_xcnmRM50\" target=\"_blank\">the Sean Spicer Show on YouTube</a>, Greene said she gives Trump credit for holding inflation steady. \"But that doesn't bring prices down,\" said Greene. \"And so gaslighting the people and trying to tell them that prices have come down is not helping. It's actually infuriating people because people know what they are paying at the grocery store, they know what they're paying for their kid's clothes and school supplies. They know what they're paying for their electricity bills.\" She called for compassion rather than lecturing. Former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore says there are three major cost issues that have to be addressed: grocery prices, home prices and health care costs. \"It is true factually that the average family has more purchasing power today than they did when Biden left office,\" said Moore. \"And yet people don't feel it. You know, they're not feeling the love. And I can't explain why that is except that people tend to focus on things where their prices are rising.\" In fact, purchasing power also grew during the Biden administration, because wages rose faster than costs. But voters didn't want to hear it then, and they are in no mood to hear it now. \"People are kind of in a crabby mood right now when it comes to the economy,\" said Moore.",

    "title": "Ken Burns shares 3 thoughts on upcoming 'American Revolution' series",
    "text": "Filmmaker Ken Burns has examined some of the most defining moments of American history. He's delved into the Civil War, dissected America's response to the Holocaust and chronicled the evolution of jazz music. For his latest project, Burns turns his lens toward The American Revolution — an event he has called the most significant since the birth of Christ. Speaking to <em>Morning Edition</em>, Burns said he wanted to \"wake people up\" to the fact that \"for most of human history, most people had been subjects under authoritarian rule and that what happened in the eastern seaboard of North America created citizens — this new thing with responsibilities.\" The <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-american-revolution/about-the-film\" target=\"_blank\">six-part series</a> — 10 years in the making — tells the story of how the American Revolution unfolded through the accounts of political and military leaders, Native soldiers, free and enslaved African soldiers and many more who played roles on both sides of the war. The first episode of <em>The American Revolution </em>airs on PBS Sunday, Nov. 16. The series was co-directed by Burns, David Schmidt and Sarah Botstein. Burns discussed his project and what he learned during its making with NPR's Michel Martin. Below are some of his thoughts: <strong>The Founding Fathers thought of future Americans as they envisioned a country</strong> The Founding Fathers, Burns said, spoke of \"unborn millions\" who would be influenced by the creation of the country and the concept of citizenship. When Thomas Jefferson spoke of the pursuit of happiness, Burns said this was not about the pursuit of material things but about lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas. \"If you led a life of lifelong learning, you would be virtuous. You would earn the right of citizenship, one of the highest honors that could be bestowed on anyone,\" Burns said. <strong>The brutality of the revolution makes it that much more significant</strong> <em>The American Revolution </em>explores just how violent the fighting was during the war. Burns said that without newsreels or photographs, current understanding of the fighting is \"limited to the romanticized paintings.\" Conversations about the revolution, he added, focus on big moments like the Continental Congress and Constitutional Convention. \"We think that if we acknowledge the violence … that somehow it will diminish those big ideas,\" Burns said. \"In fact I think that those big ideas are even more inspiring when you understand that they come out of a revolution that is bloody, just guerrilla warfare at times and unbelievably brutal, a revolution that is also a civil war.\" <strong>Division is a constant in U.S. history</strong> \"When you look at the revolution, we were really divided then, really divided,\" Burns said. \"People were killing their neighbors.\" He noted how hundreds of thousands died during the Civil War and how various bombings took place in the U.S. during the Vietnam War era. \"I think we forget that. And [in] almost every period that I've focused on, you find enormous differences between people,\" Burns said. Burns said <em>The American Revolution </em>series serves as a reminder of why America's experiment with democracy is so special. The Founding Fathers \"talked about you and me. They talked about the unborn millions,\" Burns said. \"We've got an obligation to listen to what they were offering, to understand what they thought was important … and then try to hand that off to our posterity and maybe the blips that we are so focused on, the navels that we constantly gaze at, won't seem as important.\" <em>The digital version of this story was edited by Majd Al-Waheidi.

    "text": "KYIV, Ukraine — Four people were killed after Russia unleashed a massive combined attack on Kyiv early Friday, sparking fires and scattering debris across many districts of the capital, Ukrainian authorities said. At least 27 people were injured as emergency crews responded to multiple strikes, said Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration. At least 430 drones and 18 missiles were used in the attack across the country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He said the attack, which struck other regions of the country, was targeting Kyiv. \"A specially calculated attack to cause as much harm as possible to people and civilians,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. He added the Azerbaijan Embassy was damaged by fragments of an Iskander missile. Fifteen people were hospitalized, including one man in critical condition and a pregnant woman, after a series of powerful explosions sounded in the city and airs defenses were activated. City authorities warned that power and water outages are possible. In the Darnytskyi district, debris landed in the yard of a residential building and on the grounds of an educational facility. A car caught fire after being hit by falling fragments. In the Dniprovskyi district, debris damaged three apartment buildings, a private household and caused a fire in an open area. In the Podilskyi district, five residential buildings and a nonresidential structure were damaged. In the Shevchenkivskyi district, falling debris sparked a fire in an open area near a medical facility and inside a nonresidential building. In the Holosiivskyi district, debris ignited a fire at a medical facility and damaged another nonresidential building. In the Desnianskyi district, fires were recorded in two residential buildings. In the Solomianskyi district, a fire broke out on the roof of a residential building. In the Sviatoshynskyi district, debris caused a fire in a private home. In the Kyiv region, Russian strikes damaged critical infrastructure and private homes, injuring at least one civilian, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said. A 55-year-old man in Bila Tserkva suffered thermal burns and was hospitalized, he said. Fires broke out in private houses in the capital's suburbs. The strike came as European Union officials warned this week that Ukraine must continue to crack down on corruption following a major graft scandal that has put top nuclear energy officials under scrutiny. But they also offered assurances that aid will continue to flow as Kyiv strains to hold back Russia's invasion.",

    "title": "By 2030, how much will data centers contribute to fossil fuel emissions? Scientists mapped it",
    "text": "Using data analytics – and, ironically, some artificial intelligence – a team at Cornell University has mapped the environmental impact of AI by state. They published their results in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01681-y\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nature Sustainability</em></a> this week. They determined that, by 2030, the rate of AI growth in the U.S. would put an additional 24 to 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The team further calculated that by 2030, AI could use as much water as 6 to 10 millions Americans do every year. All of this, they conclude, would put the tech industry's climate goals out of reach. As <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/07/1249592906/energy-water-ai-climate-tech\" target=\"_blank\">previously reported</a> on <em>Short Wave</em>, Google, Microsoft and Meta have all pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions and to be water positive by 2030. Amazon has set their net zero carbon deadline for 2040. But, according to this paper, AI is imperiling those climate goals. We reached out to these companies for comment. Google did not reply and the others declined to comment. A key takeaway from the study? The location of a data center matters. \"If we build AI in the right place, on a clean power grid and with efficient cooling technologies, it could really grow without blowing past water and climate limits,\" said Fengqi You, study author and a professor in energy systems engineering at Cornell University. You wants data centers to be built in places with low-water stress that are already transitioning to clean energy. Spots in the midwest and windbelt states – Texas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota – are good candidates. And tech companies have already been scouting future data centers in some of these states. <em>Interested in reporting on the environmental impact of AI?

    "text": "On Thursday night, Puerto Rican superstar <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/656561349/bad-bunny\" target=\"_blank\">Bad Bunny</a> took home the biggest prize at the Latin Grammy awards: His genre-bending homage to his island, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/g-s1-42654/bad-bunny-debi-tirar-mas-fotos-review\" target=\"_blank\"><em>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</em></a>, won album of the year. Despite the fact that he had a dozen trophies in his case before the night even began, he had never won any in the show's three major categories — album, record or song of the year. The artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio appeared perplexed as he walked onstage during the Las Vegas ceremony, initially heading in the wrong direction before he corrected course and approached the microphone to accept the night's final golden gramophone. The 31-year-old thanked his family and collaborators, and dedicated the award to all the young people of Latin America and Puerto Rico in particular. \"Hay muchas maneras de hacer patria y defender nuestra tierra — nosotros escogemos la música,\" he said. (\"There are many ways to show patriotism and defend our land — we choose music.\") Bad Bunny won four additional Latin Grammys in the urban and reggaeton categories. The Latin Grammy victories have the potential to kick off a season of wins for the rapper. He is also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5600968/2026-grammys-complete-list-of-nominations\" target=\"_blank\">nominated</a> for six awards at the Grammys, (including album of the year, song of the year and record of the year) and will <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5556772/latin-superstar-bad-bunny-will-headline-the-2026-super-bowl-halftime-show\" target=\"_blank\">headline</a> the halftime show during the Super Bowl in February. When it came to the other major categories at the 26th annual Latin Grammys — song of the year and record of the year — the Latin Recording Academy awarded familiar faces. Colombian pop-reggaetonera <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1000133788/karol-g\" target=\"_blank\">Karol G</a> received song of the year for her Dominican-infused merengue hit, \"Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido,\" alongside her fellow songwriters Edgar Barrera and Andres Jael Correa Rios. Record of the year went to Spanish artist and composer <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/altlatino/2019/09/24/763748998/2019-latin-grammy-nominations-a-big-day-for-spaniards\" target=\"_blank\">Alejandro Sanz</a> for his slow pop ballad, \"Palmeras En El Jardín.\" \"Benito, I stole it from you. Forgive me,\" Sanz joked in Spanish as he accepted the award, referring to Bad Bunny by his first name. Cameras panned to Bad Bunny, who laughed and clapped. The Latin Grammys spanned 60 categories in all, which included a wide range of genres as well as behind-the-scenes awards for production, arranging and visual media. The majority of those awards were given out earlier in the evening, before the main ceremony began in Las Vegas. Another big winner of the night was the Argentine duo <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/g-s1-25927/ca7riel-paco-amoroso-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso</a>, who took home five awards across the pop, alternative and music video categories for their exuberant yet satirical album <em>Papota</em>. (Around half of the album was recorded during their performance at NPR's Tiny Desk last year, and one NPR engineer is listed among the nominees for his contributions to the album.) The childhood best friends delivered one of the most energetic performances of the ceremony, a medley of their songs that featured prop sewing machines and bodybuilders as on-stage extras and culminated in CA7RIEL and Paco perched on top of office chairs. The award for best new artist went to Mexican alt-pop singer <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/1252663608/alt-latino-new-music-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Paloma Morphy</a>. Legacy artists like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/g-s1-87239/gloria-estefan\" target=\"_blank\">Gloria Estefan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1217258221/fito-paez\" target=\"_blank\">Fito Páez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15283727/ruben-blades\" target=\"_blank\">Rubén Blades</a> also received awards in the traditional tropical, rock and salsa categories, respectively. Brazilian soul singer <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/altlatino/2017/01/31/512470018/alt-latino-extra-liniker-barros-a-woman-who-resists-by-existing\" target=\"_blank\">Liniker</a> — who made history in 2022 as the first trans woman to ever win a Latin Grammy — was nominated for six awards, including album of the year, song of the year and record of the year. She won for best Portuguese language album, best Portuguese language urban performance and best Portuguese language song for her project <em>Caju</em>. But Liniker stole the show during a performance near the end of the ceremony, dancing her way through the funky \"Negona Dos Olhos Terriveis\" and getting celebrities like Karol G, Gloria Estefan and Elena Rose moving along with her. Winners and presenters largely avoided addressing heightened political tensions and anxieties faced by Latino communities in the United States, focusing instead on celebrating pan-Latin music and artistry. Legendary corrido band <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15872025/los-tigres-del-norte\" target=\"_blank\">Los Tigres del Norte</a> was an exception. During their performance of the socially conscious \"La Lotería,\" the group played with instruments decked out in Latin American flags. Behind them, they projected images of immigrants rights protests across the country. When power duo Gloria and Emilio Estefan accepted the Grammy for best traditional tropical album for <em>Raíces</em>, they ended their speech with a nod to the Latin diaspora. \"Se lo dedico a todos los Latinos que seguimos triunfando en todas partes del mundo,\" Emilio Estefan said. \"Viva la musica Latina.\" (\"I dedicate this to all of us Latinos who keep succeeding all over the world. Long live Latin music.\")",

    "title": "Comey and James seek case dismissal, arguing prosecutor was illegally appointed",
    "text": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a judge Thursday to dismiss the cases against them, saying the prosecutor who secured the indictments was illegally installed in the role. U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie said she expects to decide by Thanksgiving on challenges to Lindsey Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. That decision could help determine the fate of the politically charged cases, which were both shepherded by the hastily installed Halligan and together have amplified concerns that the Justice Department is being used as a weapon to target President Donald Trump's perceived adversaries. Halligan was installed in the job at Trump's urging by Attorney General Pam Bondi in September, just days before Comey was indicted, in what defense lawyers say was an end-run around the constitutional and statutory rules governing the appointment of U.S. attorneys. They say the maneuver was designed to ensure indictments against the president's political opponents after the prosecutor who had been overseeing the two investigations, but had not brought charges, was effectively forced out. \"Ms. Halligan was the sole prosecutor in the grand jury room, and when the sole prosecutor lacks the authority,\" said Ephraim McDowell, one of Comey's defense lawyers, \"that's not going to be a harmless error.\" U.S. attorneys, top federal prosecutors who oversee regional Justice Department outposts across the country, are typically nominated by the president and then confirmed by the Senate. Attorneys general do have the authority to name an interim U.S. attorney who can serve for 120 days, but lawyers for Comey and James argued that once that period expires, the law gives federal judges the exclusive say of who gets to fill the vacancy. <h3><strong>The interim US attorney resigned under pressure</strong></h3> After then-interim U.S. attorney Erik Siebert resigned in September while facing Trump administration pressure to bring charges against Comey and James, Bondi installed Halligan, a White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience. The appointment followed a Trump post on Truth Social in which he complained to Bondi about the lack of prosecutorial action against his political enemies and said, \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" Siebert had been appointed by Bondi in January to serve as interim U.S. attorney. Trump in May announced his intention to nominate him, and judges in the Eastern District unanimously agreed after his 120-day period expired that he should be retained in the role. But after the Trump administration effectively pushed him out in September, the Justice Department again opted to make an interim appointment in place of the courts, something defense lawyers say it was not empowered under the law to do. \"If the government were to prevail here,\" McDowell said, then it \"would never need to go through Senate confirmation again for U.S. attorneys.\" He said any dismissal of the indictment must be permanent, with no opportunity to bring the case again, to avoid rewarding the government for a violation. <h3><strong>The Justice Department defends Halligan's appointment</strong></h3> The Justice Department maintains that the law does not explicitly prohibit successive appointments of interim U.S. attorneys by the attorney general. Henry Whitaker, a lawyer for the department, argued that the indictment was properly returned by a grand jury and should not be dismissed over what he described as at most a paperwork or clerical error. \"The grand jury made a decision based on the facts and the law, and they followed their oath,\" Whitaker said. He also said that even if there were questions about Halligan's appointment, they were resolved by the fact that Bondi had personally ratified the indictment and reviewed the grand jury proceedings. But Currie, the judge, questioned whether that was possible given that a section of the grand jury proceedings that were produced to her was, for unexplained reasons, missing a section. A Justice Department spokesperson later said that there was no missing time and that the time period in question concerns when the grand jury was deliberating, which \"would not be included in a transcription.\" Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, and James, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty to mortgage fraud allegations. The challenges to Halligan's appointment are part of a multiprong effort to get the prosecutions tossed before trial. Their lawyers have separately argued that the prosecutions are improperly vindictive and motivated by the president's personal animus toward their clients and should therefore be dismissed. <h3><strong>Trump's history with Comey and James</strong></h3> Comey, as FBI director in the early months of Trump's first term, infuriated the president through his oversight of an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump fired Comey in May 2017. The two have been open adversaries since, with Comey labeling Trump \"unethical\" and comparing him to a Mafia boss and Trump branding Comey an \"untruthful slime ball\" and calling for him to be punished because of the Russia investigation. James has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against him and the Trump Organization in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud.",

    "title": "The best new albums out Nov. 14",
    "text": "It's Friday, it's mid-November, and the weekly deluge of new albums felt like it was finally starting to slow down as we approach the holidays — until we looked at our Nov. 14 list of LPs, EPs, compilations and reissues and saw triple digits. There's no offseason in this business. The most anticipated album out this week is Summer Walker's <em>Finally Over It</em> ... which we did not get to hear in advance, but that didn't stop us from marveling at <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2025/11/13/summer-walker-finally-over-it-album-rollout-timeline\" target=\"_blank\">the Atlanta R&B star's promo acumen</a>. With 26 featured guests across 18 tracks, it's going to challenge Taylor Swift for the top spot on the <em>Billboard</em> 200. The other prestige release this week comes from FKA twigs, whose deluxe edition of <em>EUSEXUA</em> turned into an entirely new album. We get into that and much more on New Music Friday, our weekly podcast running down our favorite new LPs (and sometimes EPs) of each Friday. Each week, we welcome a different DJ from the NPR Music network of public radio stations, and this episode's guest is the esteemed <a href=\"https://wdet.org/shows/alternate-take/\" target=\"_blank\">Liz Warner from WDET</a> in Detroit, where she hosts an eclectic program called Alternate Take.

    "title": "Remembering Armero: Colombia's town buried in tragedy",
    "text": "ARMERO, Colombia — Touring the ruins of this once-bustling farm town, veterinarian Fernando Angarita points to the overgrown lots where the bakery, the hospital and the Presbyterian church once stood. Amid the rubble sits a boulder the size of a cargo truck that arrived with the avalanche that buried Armero on Nov. 13, 1985. The deluge was caused by the eruption of snowcapped Nevado del Ruiz volcano 30 miles west of town. Warnings to evacuate arrived too late. The flood of lava, mud and debris killed 25,000 people. Angarita was climbing a tree to escape when he was caught by the massive mudslide. It carried him nearly 4 miles out of town before he could crawl to safety. He suffered 16 fractures to his face and jaw and compared the experience to being inside a blender. Angarita, who is now 71, says: \"I have no idea why I'm still alive.\" This week, Colombians are marking the 40th anniversary of the Armero tragedy with solemn ceremonies and renewed efforts to clarify what's become of town residents who went missing. \"Armero is a part of Colombian history. It was the worst natural disaster in Latin America with a huge number of victims,\" said Maurcio Cuéllar, a survivor of the tragedy and <a href=\"https://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/otras-ciudades/alcalde-de-guayabal-sigue-esperando-a-su-hermano-desaparecido-40-anos-despues-de-la-tragedia-de-armero-el-tenia-8-anitos-3508705\" target=\"_blank\">mayor of the nearby town of Guayabal</a>, where many Armero residents resettled. Although Nevado del Ruiz is a highly active volcano, there were few warnings ahead of the 1985 eruption. The lava melted part of the snowcap and created a massive mudslide that flowed down a river valley where Armero was located.  Many residents were glued to their TV sets for a big soccer match and had no idea something was wrong until the lights went out at about 9:30 p.m. and they heard a roar. \"The sound was like a whole bunch of helicopters in the sky,\" said Marco Rivera, who was 18 at the time and found refuge behind the sturdy gate of the town's cemetery. \"Lights were flashing in the dark because the mudslide swallowed up cars with their lights on and they were flipping over and over.\" Armero, once home to 29,000 residents, was never rebuilt. These days tour guides lead people through a wasteland of half-buried buildings and makeshift gravestones. Asthar Vreeswijk, a Dutch tourist, found Armero more moving than the petrified ruins of Pompeii. \"If you're going to visit a place like this in Europe, it's totally structured and like renovated. You don't feel that it happened for real,\" she said. \"But here, everything it's like how it was. So, it's quite powerful.\" The biggest attraction is a shrine to Omayra Sánchez. Only 13, she was found by rescue workers in water up to her neck and trapped by the debris of her family's ruined house. As they tried to save her, she spoke to <a href=\"https://www.rtve.es/play/videos/informe-semanal/informe-semanal-recuerdo-omaira/930400/\" target=\"_blank\">TV journalists</a>. \"Mommy, if you can hear me, pray so that I can walk again and that these people can help me,\" she said. After spending 70 hours in the water, Sánchez died of hypothermia. Many Colombians now view her as a kind of saint and at her gravesite they've placed hundreds of stone plaques thanking her for the blessings they believe she's bestowed upon them. If Nevado del Ruiz erupts again Colombia should be better prepared. Amid criticism of the belated and uncoordinated rescue efforts 40 years ago, the government created a <a href=\"https://portal.gestiondelriesgo.gov.co/\" target=\"_blank\">special agency to respond to disasters</a> while early warning systems have been installed in several towns near the volcano. Meanwhile, the search for possible missing people continues. Survivors reported a total of 583 missing children, says Francisco González, an Armero native who is leading an investigation into what happened to them. He acknowledges that many of these children likely perished in the landslide. Others were quickly adopted. However, chaos reigned after the landslide, record-keeping was shoddy, and the fate of these children may never be known. Even so, the Colombian government's child welfare agency, which handles adoptions, has pledged to open its records and archives to try to clarify what happened. Adriana Tierradentro, one of the agency's directors, told NPR: \"We will provide all the information that we can.\" In a symbolic search for truth, relatives of the missing launched hundreds of model boats into a river near Armero. Their tiny sails were emblazoned with photos of the missing. Among them is the younger brother of Mariela Díaz. Every year, she makes a pilgrimage back to her hometown of Armero to look for him. \"My brother <em>did</em> survive. Lots of people saw him. A doctor saw a photo of him and told me that he treated him,\" Díaz says. \"So, we still have hope that, maybe, he will reappear.",

    "title": "DIY Disney? The company is exploring AI so fans can make content from Disney stories",
    "text": "Fans tired of waiting for the next <em>Frozen</em> sequel or the next chapter in the <em>Star Wars</em> saga may soon have new ways to engage with those worlds — by creating their own content using Disney's IP. That was the tantalizing hint Disney CEO Bob Iger dropped during an <a href=\"https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-q4-fy25-earnings-results-webcast/\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a> Thursday, as he described how the company is exploring ways to make the Disney+ subscription-based streaming service more interactive, and customizable for users. While Iger stopped short of making any formal announcements, he suggested Disney is in discussions with artificial intelligence companies about tools that could allow subscribers to generate and share their own content built from Disney-owned stories. \"AI is going to give us the ability to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content,\" Iger said. Disney+ declined to offer additional details about what form these new creative tools might take or which tech companies were involved in the negotiations. Meanwhile, AI remains a concern in many parts of the entertainment industry, with many companies including Disney <a href=\"https://copyrightalliance.org/artificial-intelligence-copyright/court-cases/\" target=\"_blank\">engaged in lawsuits</a> against AI players for copyright infringement. Iger acknowledged this tension. On the earnings call, the CEO said the company's conversations with potential AI partners are focused on enabling new forms of fan engagement <em>and</em> guarding against uses that could dilute or misuse Disney IP. \"It's obviously imperative for us to protect our IP with this new technology,\" Iger said. <h3><strong>The trend towards increased interactivity </strong></h3> Disney isn't alone in trying to rethink the boundaries between audiences and the entertainment they consume. At the recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> conference in San Francisco, Netflix's chief technology officer, Elizabeth Stone, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjI8hFzwZUA\" target=\"_blank\">offered</a> her own look at a future shaped by deeper user engagement. \"The future of entertainment is likely to be even more personalized, even more interactive, even more immersive,\" Stone said during an on-stage conversation with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos. In addition to games and social media videos, one of Netflix's most talked-about experiments in this direction arrives next year: Stone said viewers of the classic talent competition <em>Star Search</em> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/star-search-live-release-date-casting-news\" target=\"_blank\">reboot</a> will be able to cast votes directly from their TVs or phones, influencing which contestants advance – or do not. <h3><strong>Younger audiences and deal-making climate drive quest for interactivity</strong></h3> This engagement layer sits on top of Netflix's vast library of films and TV series. But platform leaders increasingly see passive watching as only part of the picture. Younger audiences, especially Gen Z, are gravitating toward spaces where they can participate, remix and respond rather than simply watch. According to Deloitte's 2025 Digital Media Trends <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-telecom-outlooks/2025-media-entertainment-outlook.html\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a>, more than half of Gen Z respondents say social media content feels more relevant to them than traditional TV shows and movies. The research also points to the growing popularity of indie creators, and a change in consumer expectations around quality: Content doesn't always have to be polished to be extremely popular, as some of the most-watched feeds on YouTube and TikTok prove. At the same time, despite ongoing litigation, entertainment corporations are starting to get comfortable with the idea of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5598492/new-licensing-deal-highlights-the-growing-trend-of-media-giants-embracing-ai\" target=\"_blank\">licensing content</a> to AI companies. One of the most high-profile in recent weeks is the licensing <a href=\"https://www.universalmusic.com/universal-music-group-and-udio-announce-udios-first-strategic-agreements-for-new-licensed-ai-music-creation-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">partnership</a> between Universal Music Group and the AI music creation platform Udio. \"It shows that the AI companies can work with the creative community to come up with models that work for both of them,\" Copyright Alliance CEO Keith Kupferschmid told NPR regarding this particular deal. \"And I think we're going to start seeing more and more deals come through because they realize they can do this and do it the right way.",

    "text": "The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/12/g-s1-97607/house-vote-shutdown-end\" target=\"_blank\">deal Congress reached</a> to re-open the federal government requires the Trump administration to reinstate federal workers who were fired in October, including those charged with overseeing the nation's special education laws. But it's not clear how long they'll be back. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/13/nx-s1-5572489/trump-special-education-department-funding-layoffs-disabilities\" target=\"_blank\">As NPR has reported</a>, the Office for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) inside the U.S. Department of Education is the central nervous system for programs that support students with disabilities. It not only offers guidance to families but also oversees state compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). OSERS can't do its job without staff, and, according to <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.457131/gov.uscourts.cand.457131.112.6.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a new Education Department filing</a>, the office lost 121 of its 135 employees in the October reduction-in-force. That matters because, while Wednesday's funding agreement will return those workers to \"employment status\" as of Sept. 30, there appears to be little protecting them after Jan. 30, when that provision expires. \"We are concerned special education will cease to exist,\" says Jacqueline Rodriguez, CEO of the National Center for Learning Disabilities<em>.  </em> The Education Department did not answer specific questions from NPR about whether workers who were cut in October would be allowed to resume their work, as opposed to being put on administrative leave, or if the department would try to fire them again after the deal expires. The department offered only this statement: \"The Department has brought back staff that were impacted by the Schumer Shutdown. The Department will follow all applicable laws.\" If OSERS stays a shadow of its former self, Rodriguez says, \"the only conclusion that we can draw is that it is an intentional dismantling of the entire system of special education<em>.\" </em> <h3>The Office for Civil Rights has also seen big cuts</h3> Another Education Department office that supports students with disabilities was also decimated by the October cuts. Families often turn to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) when they fear their child has been illegally denied special education services. But the Education Department's recent court filing shows the extent of the administration's efforts to gut that office: OCR lost 299 staffers after the March reduction-in-force but, because of a lawsuit, most (247) remain on temporary, paid administrative leave. Another 137 were cut in the October reduction-in-force, which has been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5585083/government-shutdown-trump-rif-layoffs\" target=\"_blank\">paused by a federal judge</a>. Under the new government funding agreement, those 137 staffers should be reinstated, at least until Jan. 30. By the department's own numbers, that means just 62 staffers of OCR's current 446 employees have not received RIF notices. That's roughly 10% of the office's <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/ed-dept-offices-will-be-virtually-wiped-out-in-latest-layoffs/2025/10\" target=\"_blank\">600-plus headcount in January</a>, when the second Trump administration began. OCR and OSERS are both mandated by <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-726/pdf/COMPS-726.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">federal law</a>. \"I've got to say, I'm just shocked that they can destroy an entire unit of an organization that's created by statute<em>,\"</em> said R. Shep Melnick, a professor of American politics at Boston College who has been writing about OCR for decades. If the office is not returned to previous staffing levels, with at least enough attorneys to field and investigate individual discrimination complaints from families, Melnick says OCR \"will have to reinvent itself. And I fear it's going to reinvent itself in a way that it will just be a political arm of the administration.<em>\"</em> In spite of these staff cuts, the administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5500262/trump-civil-rights-schools-students\" target=\"_blank\">has aggressively used OCR</a> to enforce its new interpretations of civil rights laws, going after school districts and colleges that continue to provide protections for transgender students or embrace diversity, equity and inclusion.",

That lawsuit eventually resulted in a settlement, but it took years. One current air traffic controller told NPR they didn't receive a check from that agreement until this year — just weeks before the government shutdown once again in October. \"I just got a $400 check, just, like, maybe a week before the shutdown, that was from that 2019 shutdown,\" said a controller who handles high-altitude traffic at a facility in the Midwest. He asked NPR to withhold his name because he's afraid of retaliation from the Federal Aviation Administration. This controller says the FAA did a poor job of tracking overtime and shift differentials during the prior shutdown, and he's dreading the task of calculating how much he is owed this time. \"It's just a nightmare,\" the controller said, \"trying to make sure we get paid back correctly for all of our differentials and overtime.\" In remarks this week, Secretary Duffy described a much speedier process for controllers to get their back pay this time around. \"In this package to reopen the government, our controllers could be paid within 48 hours of the government opening,\" Duffy told reporters in Wisconsin on Tuesday. \"They'll get a big lump sum of what they're due, which is helpful. They don't have to wait another two weeks to be paid.\" Air traffic controllers missed two full paychecks over the last six weeks, as well as part of a third. Duffy said this week that controllers would receive 70% of their pay within 48 hours of the government reopening, with the remaining 30% about a week after the first payment. \"So I encourage all of them to come to work to be patriots and help navigate the airspace effectively for the American people,\" Duffy said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lswone1bzl8\" target=\"_blank\">at a press conference</a> Tuesday in Chicago. Still, some controllers are wary. \"On the last one, we weren't properly paid out,\" said one current controller who works arriving and departing traffic at a major U.S. airport, who also asked NPR not to use his name out of fear of retaliation from the FAA. \"Our pay has all these differentials and adjustments in it. Overtime, night pay, Sunday pay, training pay, all different kinds of stuff that you can get,\" the controller said. \"So I sat and I calculated for the whole 35-day shutdown what that should work out to. And I had to do that all by hand, which, you know, sucked.\" \"I wasn't made whole until May, and the shutdown ended in January,\" the controller said. Some controllers had to wait even longer. Dozens of controllers <a href=\"https://www.natca.org/2019/02/21/natca-s-shutdown-5th-amendment-claim-withdrawn/\" target=\"_blank\">sued in 2019</a>, alleging that the government withheld overtime and other pay in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. \"Plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, even to this date, have not received any payment for overtime work they performed during the FAA's lapse in appropriations,\" lawyers for the controllers wrote. The Trump administration fought in court to have the case dismissed, but that motion was denied. The parties eventually agreed to a settlement earlier this year. The National Association of Air Traffic Controllers, the union that represents those controllers, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The union referred questions about the most recent shutdown to the FAA. NPR asked the Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Transportation to explain how controllers would receive the back pay they are currently owed, but neither agency responded. However Secretary Duffy has expressed support for the idea of paying a $10,000 bonus to air traffic controllers who worked through the recent shutdown, a proposal first floated by President Trump in <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115526123205979749\" target=\"_blank\">a Truth Social post</a> on Monday. \"The air traffic controllers who didn't miss a day, they came for every scheduled shift that they had, they should get a bonus,\" Duffy said Tuesday in Chicago. \"President Trump, brilliant!,\" Duffy said. \"We are going to pay them a bonus that'll be $10,000. Depending on how many we have, they should come to the White House, and he should present them with their checks.",

    "title": "A decade after the Bataclan attacks, France is still grappling with how to remember",
    "text": "PARIS — Arthur Dénouveaux's memories of Nov. 13, 2015, aren't exactly hazy. Nor are they perfect. \"What I remember from that night are a few very clear pictures,\" he says. Dénouveaux was one of around 1,500 people inside the Bataclan concert hall to see the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal, when gunmen linked to the Islamic State opened fire. What he remembers next are fragments. There was the muzzle flash coming out of the gunmen's Kalashnikovs. Being pushed to the floor as the crowd scrambled. A girl \"completely lost,\" staring toward the shooters before others pulled her down. Then Dénouveaux remembers crawling outside. \"Finding myself under the night sky in Paris,\" he says, \"and saying to myself, 'Hey, I'm free again.'\" Across Paris that night, 130 people were killed at cafés, the national soccer stadium and the Bataclan. Ten years later, France is still wrestling with how to remember the deadliest attack on its soil in modern history and how to live with it. The country has built an extensive system of remembrance. There have been books, documentaries, plaques and memorials across the city. A landmark 10-month terrorism trial ended in 2022 with the conviction of 20 men, including the only surviving member of the group that carried out the attacks. On Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron visited each of the attack sites before inaugurating a new memorial garden behind Paris City Hall. At the Place de la République this week, people placed flowers and lit candles at a makeshift memorial.  For some, like Paris resident Anaelle Baheux, who lives just steps from one of the cafés attacked that night, these rituals still matter. \"It's reassuring to see that people didn't forget what happened,\" she says. But even as the rituals deepen, new research shows the details of that night are already fading from collective memory — and a study is offering insights into why some people recover from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, more easily than others.  Denis Peschanski, a historian, has been co-leading a 12-year study examining how the Nov. 13 attacks are remembered across French society. The project has followed nearly 1,000 people — survivors, victims' families, first responders and ordinary citizens — interviewing them at regular intervals to track how their recollections change over time. \"It's an interesting question, why did people forget,\" Peschanski says. He says one pattern stands out: While most people still remember the Bataclan vividly, their recollections of what happened at the cafés and the national stadium are \"foggier,\" if not forgotten altogether. For survivors from those sites, Peschanski calls this a \"<em>double peine</em>\" — a double punishment. They live not only with trauma, but also with the feeling that their part of the story has faded from public memory. Alongside the national memory study, <a href=\"https://www.memoire13novembre.fr/content/english\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a team of neuroscientists</u></a> has spent the past decade studying trauma on an individual level, tracking about 200 survivors through regular MRI scans and psychological assessments. Pierre Gagnepain, one of the lead researchers, says early treatment approaches often discouraged the idea of intentionally trying to suppress traumatic memories. \"For a long time, people thought that suppression was not good, that trying to block memory made things even worse,\" Gagnepain says. \"People used to say it would cause even more intrusive memories.\" But their initial findings suggest the opposite: suppression can, in fact, be part of recovery. \"What's important to understand is that forgetting — or suppression — doesn't mean you don't remember what happened to you,\" Gagnepain says. \"It's about making the memory less present, less vivid, less accessible. People can still describe what they went through. It's just that the memory becomes less intrusive, less invading.\" The science suggests that memory blurs not because people don't care, but because the mind adapts.  MRI findings from this study show that when memory control networks begin to recover — meaning when certain neural connections are strengthened and the brain's ability to inhibit intrusive thoughts is restored — survivors of traumatic events are less likely to suffer persistent intrusive symptoms of PTSD. But not everyone. About a third of survivors in the study remain \"chronic\" cases, stuck in a state where fear and memory remain tightly linked. Bataclan survivor Arthur Dénouveaux wasn't part of the MRI research, but he recognizes the distinction. He says his personal memories remain accessible without overwhelming him. \"You know, I can touch them. I can feel them,\" he says. \"It's not just something out of thin air. My body was there. My mind was there.\" For the past decade, Dénouveaux has served as president of Life for Paris, a support group created weeks after the attacks to help survivors navigate medical care, bureaucracy and years of legal proceedings that followed. From the start, he says, the group intended to disband after the 10th anniversary. \"It feels like that point in time when you can say, 'No, I'm not a victim anymore. I have been a victim. I used to be a victim,'\" he says. That doesn't mean forgetting — for Dénouveaux or for France. Moving forward, he says, is its own kind of healing.",

    "text": "The Smithsonian museums, National Gallery of Art and other sites that receive federal funding are announcing their reopening plans now that the government shutdown is over. While the financial impact of this particular shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, has not yet been calculated, past closures have been costly to museums and other cultural sites that were forced to close. In addition to staff furloughs and suspended or canceled programs, the 2018-2019 shutdown resulted in a loss of some $5 billion, according to the <a href=\"https://www.aam-us.org/2025/09/30/info-sheet-how-government-shutdowns-impact-museums-and-the-cultural-sector/\" target=\"_blank\">American Alliance of Museums</a>. That figure includes roughly $3.4 million from the Smithsonian's gift shops, concessions and IMAX film screenings and, for the National Gallery of Art, \"an estimated 334,000 visitors, including 11,700 schoolchildren, and an estimated $1.2 million in gross revenue from its shops and restaurants,\" according to a September report from the group. \"We're glad to see these museums are able to reopen, but we know from past shutdowns that cultural institutions lose millions in revenue they can never recover,\" said Marilyn Jackson, president and CEO of the American Alliance of Museums in an email to NPR, \"And it's not just the museums but the restaurants, hotels, and small businesses that depend on cultural tourism who suffer alongside them.\" Here's a roundup: <strong>Smithsonian Institution</strong> The Smithsonian, which includes 21 museums and the National Zoo, will reopen on a \"rolling basis.\" Beginning Friday, Nov. 14, the National Museum of American History, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia will reopen. All other museums and the National Zoo — including the popular animal <a href=\"https://nationalzoo.si.edu/webcams\" target=\"_blank\">cams</a> — will reopen by Monday, Nov. 17. Updates will be posted <a href=\"http://si.edu/visit\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. <strong>National Gallery of Art</strong> The National Gallery of Art, one of the most visited art museums in the world, will reopen its West Building and outdoor Sculpture Garden on Friday, Nov. 14.

The Wednesday vote was the first time House members voted since House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sent members home after the chamber passed its initial version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. \"The House did its job,\" Johnson said on the third day of the shutdown when asked why he wasn't having members stay in town. \"The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government.\" He kept his word but<strong> </strong>tensions were high when members returned this week. \"Long time, no see. I hardly recognize you guys,\" said House Rules Committee ranking member Jim McGovern, D-Mass., at a meeting. \"Where the hell have you been?\" After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., stepped in. \"I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation. I worked every day,\" she said. \"I don't want to hear another soul say that.\" Although House leadership in both parties held press conferences every day during the shutdown, there was no legislative business of the House for over seven weeks. \"The halls have been pretty, pretty lonely,\" said California Republican Kevin Kiley on Wednesday. Unlike Republicans, rank and file House Democrats were instructed by their leaders to come to D.C. regularly for caucus meetings.<strong> </strong> But <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/27/nx-s1-5586745/house-republican-kevin-kiley-work-capitol-hill-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">Kiley kept showing up to his Capitol office</a> throughout the shutdown. \"This has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering,\" he told NPR. \"I don't think that either party comes out of this thing in the best light.\" Kiley said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/04/nx-s1-5562517/aca-obamacare-shutdown-trump-naic-health-insurance\" target=\"_blank\">Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year</a> – the crux of the shutdown itself. \"That was, I guess, one advantage of being here – that I have had some constructive conversations like that,\" he said. \"But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having the sort of consensus building process that you need to pass legislation like this.\" Other GOP members, like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/27/g-s1-85288/gop-townhalls-missouri-rep-mark-alford\" target=\"_blank\">Missouri Rep. Mark Alford</a>, said the time back home was useful. \"In a way, this time away working in the district has been very, very helpful,\" he told NPR. \"I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been [in Congress]. We went to farms, we went to businesses, we visited 14 of our 18 rural hospitals in our district, and it gave us a real clear picture of where America stands right now and what we can do to help.\" Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the chamber was sent home in the first place. \"I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment. I think it was disrespectful to the body,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Texas. She called it \"poor form\" for the speaker not to swear in fellow Democrat<strong> </strong>Adelita Grijalva, who won an Arizona special election in mid-September and was waiting to be sworn in during the shutdown. Grijalva told NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5605849/seven-weeks-after-winning-arizona-democrat-may-soon-be-sworn-in-to-house-seat\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All Things Considered</em></a><em> </em>she thinks her support of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/16/g-s1-93709/adelita-grijalva-mike-johnson-swearing-in\" target=\"_blank\">effort to release the Jeffrey Epstein files</a> played a role in her wait to get seated. \"I really like this lady.

But she's here now and I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn't missed a vote.\" Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., said swearing in Grijalva during the shutdown is just one of the business items of the chamber that should have been done last month. \"For the last 54 days, the House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on,\" she told NPR. \"People are angry about the lack of accountability.\" Stansbury added: \"We should have been here for the entire time.\" Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., agreed with that. \"We were gone far too long,\" he told NPR. \"I didn't want to go home in August [for recess]. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just – that's just more than Americans should have to put up with.\" Womack, a longtime appropriator, said he has his eye on the end of January — when Congress has to finish the rest of its spending bills. \"We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days,\" he said. \"We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll.",

    "title": "Dealing with social anxiety? How to know and overcome fear",
    "text": "A lot of us get nervous in social situations, such as going on a first date, dinner with friends or speaking in front of a group of people. But at what point do nerves turn into full-blown social anxiety? “People who have social phobia or social anxiety really have this intense and persistent fear of being judged, embarrassed, or rejected in social or performance situations,” said <a href=\"https://katimorton.com/?srsltid=AfmBOop-4IlRdTJ6k4nwhBJsM7yMvc46jYl17JrtofeswB7AFsGAiua0\">Kati Morton</a>, a licensed therapist based in Austin, Texas, and author of the upcoming book, “Why Do I Keep Doing This? Unlearn the Habits Keeping You Stuck and Unhappy.” “They essentially can&#8217;t even focus, cannot have conversations. They&#8217;re so concerned about what other people think,” she said.  “They kind of get caught up in their own thoughts and will avoid the situations altogether.” <h3>5 questions with Kati Morton</h3> <strong>What causes social anxiety? </strong> “It can come from a lot of different places. For most of my patients and people I&#8217;ve spoken with over the years, it comes from childhood. A lot of times, we can feel judged when we&#8217;re younger. Say we were bullied, let&#8217;s say we were left out. Let&#8217;s say our confidence is really low, you know, maybe our parents weren&#8217;t super supportive. I mean, there&#8217;s really a ton of different places anxiety can come from — each person&#8217;s is individual — but I do think it&#8217;s important to recognize that anxiety is the most common mental illness in the U.S., and therefore I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if a lot of people do have social anxiety.” <strong>What are the physical symptoms?</strong> “A lot of people will say that the physical manifestations of that fear is a racing heart, sweaty palms, like butterflies in the stomach. It can feel like we&#8217;re gonna pass out. A lot of people say they almost feel like they&#8217;re drowning and dying at the same time. It also can cause digestive issues, which you can imagine, all of these symptoms can make the social anxiety feel even more uncomfortable.” <strong>What can you do if you feel anxious in a social setting?</strong> “The best thing you can do in the moment is to step away. That&#8217;s a great opportunity to say, ‘Oh, I&#8217;m just going to go to the bathroom really quick. I&#8217;ll be out in just a few minutes.’ [When] you go in the bathroom, you can do a full body shake, which I know sounds kind of strange, but when we feel queued up like that, when we feel anxious, that gives our nervous system a release, and if we don&#8217;t take an action, that&#8217;s when we can have things like a panic attack or we can start to have more of those symptoms like I feel like I&#8217;m going to faint or I&#8217;m gonna throw up or any of those. And so if you shake, you give your nervous system a release for that energy. So that&#8217;s always my number one. “My second is to do some deep breathing, you know, I love, I call it four by four breathing or box breathing, breathe in for four [seconds], hold it for four, breathe out for four, do it four times. Easy. You can do it even if you can&#8217;t step away. People might not even realize that you&#8217;re doing it. If you don&#8217;t have makeup on, you can splash cold water in your face. Those are [for] the moment, save you and pull you out of that anxious spiral.” <strong>How can you stop replaying situations in your head or reframe your thinking?</strong> “So I want you to think of a memory that feels really good, and I want you to pretend you&#8217;re telling me all about it. Tell me about that one vacation you took to Hawaii, or tell me about that wonderful day you had off where you just had nothing to do and you walked around town. Tell me about it. What do you smell? Use all your senses. What are you tasting? And go through that memory in as much detail for as long as you can, and I find most of my patients will say, ‘I didn&#8217;t even get all the way through the memory and I fell asleep.’” <strong>Should you ever avoid social situations altogether? </strong> “I don&#8217;t for the most part because the way that social anxiety works in our brain and body is that as we kind of retract, like say no and stay home, the more we prove to our system that we can&#8217;t handle it. And so I always want to challenge people to try anyways, like do some tools, like dunk your face, shake out, have a ritual, get yourself prepped and do it. But I also want to hold space for the fact that some people might feel almost into a panic attack already, just sitting in their car, waiting to drive to go somewhere. And if you find yourself that heightened, it might be better you don&#8217;t [go]. I still want you to do all the things we talked about like the shakeouts and talking yourself down, stopping the rumination, doing all of that, but that day just might not be your day. So if you feel like your resilience is low and you essentially cannot weather the storm of a social event, it&#8217;s OK to not go. I just don&#8217;t want that to become a pattern that we get caught in, because like I said, it only reinforces the social anxiety, and that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re here to do.” <em>This interview was edited for clarity.</em> ____ <em><a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/samantha-raphelson\">Samantha Raphelson</a> produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a class=\"elr\" href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/catherine-welch\">Catherine Welch</a>.

    "text": "Ethan Hawke admits that he has an obsession with time.  \"Acting forces you to be aware of time,\" he says. \"The stories I gravitate to, particularly in the films with [director] <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5592936/richard-linklater-nouvelle-vague-jean-luc-godard-blue-moon\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Linklater</a>, ... I often think Father Time is the main character of all the films we've done together.\" Hawke was only 13 when he made his first film,<em> Explorers.</em> He became a star at 18 with <em>Dead Poets Society. </em>More than 30 years later, he's still acting, except now when he gets a script he forgets he's no longer a young guy. \"I'll be sent a script and it says, 'Billy, age 19, skateboarding down the street,' and I think, 'Oh that's my part,'\" Hawke says. \"It takes me a while to realize, 'Oh, Billy's father, age 55, gruff and weathered around the edges. ... Oh, that's me.\" Hawke says his new film <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/17/nx-s1-5573091/blue-moon-ethan-hawke-lorenz-hart-richard-rodgers\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Blue Moon</em></a><em> </em>is one of the most challenging of his career. In it, he plays lyricist Lorenz Hart, the original songwriting partner of composer Richard Rodgers. The film captures Hart on the night that <em>Oklahoma!</em>, Rodgers' musical with his new songwriting partner Oscar Hammerstein, debuts. Hart was afraid of being left behind and was a bundle of contradictions, simultaneously proud of his former partner and jealous of his success.  \"I felt I was being asked to play two things at the same time, which is of course why I wanna do it,\" Hawke says. \"Every now and then you bump up against a part that presses you to the wall of your ability and you know you can never be as good as the part is demanding of you — and that's a kind of thrilling spot to be in.\" <em>Blue Moon</em> is Hawke's ninth collaboration with filmmaker Linklater. (Their previous films include <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/07/10/330291891/filmed-over-12-years-boyhood-follows-a-kids-coming-of-age\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Boyhood</em> </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2013/05/30/184269413/before-midnight-love-darkens-and-deepens\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Before</em> trilogy</a>.) He's also starring in the horror film<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/17/nx-s1-5576422/in-black-phone-2-the-grabber-is-dialed-in\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Black Phone 2</em></a><em> </em>and in the FX streaming series, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550035/the-lowdown-review-ethan-hawke-fx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Lowdown</em></a>. <hr /> <h3>Interview highlights </h3> <strong>On working with Linklater on <em>Blue Moon</em></strong> He knows every trick in my toolbox and he was really asking me to disappear. He just wanted me to be Larry Hart. And so, the man has spent years of his life editing my performances. So anytime he would see me, he would say, \"I saw you!\" ... The physical things are kind of easy. ... Anybody can shave their head and do a comb-over. But it was really the soul of a person who was loathing themselves, and at the same time, thinks they're smarter than everybody else. ... Imagine if you only worked with one other person for 25 years and you achieved incredible heights and this person now doesn't wanna work with you anymore. So it's truly heartbreaking for him because I think he's smart enough to know that the world is changing, we're in the middle of the war, the jazz age is being left behind, something new is happening and he's not gonna be a part of it. <strong>On playing a journalist writing about corruption in <em>The Lowdown</em></strong> It's been a funny year for me because<em> Blue Moon </em>is probably the most different I've ever pushed myself outside the framework of my own identity. And then <em>The Lowdown</em> — I just relate to Lee, he's Quixote, chasing windmills, running into propellers. He's a dreamer and an idealist and self-centered, and doesn't see his own blind spots, and he's a moron, and I just completely relate to him. He can say the right thing all the time and do the wrong thing all of the time. And out of that obviously comes a lot of humor.  I kind of saw Lee as a guy who's frozen in 1996, or something. I'm still wearing the same pants I wore back then. I got the same belt buckle I wore back then. He's still listening to the same music he listened to back then. And I admire him, and I also identify with his shortcomings. [Series creator] <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/09/19/1123452609/reservation-dogs-sterlin-harjo-native-stories\" target=\"_blank\">Sterlin [Harjo</a>] is really fun to work with. I had a great time on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/08/02/1191671833/the-unassumingly-brilliant-reservation-dogs-is-back-for-its-third-and-final-seas\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reservation Dogs</em></a>. We got along like a house on fire. I can't remember a time I just ran with the character like I did with this one. <strong>On losing his friends </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2013/10/27/241145317/river-phoenixs-eccentric-upbringing-tragic-death\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>River Phoenix</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/02/02/270637235/philip-seymour-hoffman-an-uncanny-actor-of-stage-and-screen\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Philip Seymour Hoffman</strong></a><strong> to overdoses</strong> River was very sensitive, extremely sensitive and it's part of his genius. … Some of us get second chances and some of our DNA is hardwired to protect ourselves and some people don't have those guardrails. And I don't understand it, and I know that the answer is you have to know yourself. … Of course it was a warning. But we all get warnings. And I sometimes think a lot of it is accident. I remember when we were 23, I felt that we had lived, and now here I am, I'm about to be 55 years old and I've lived twice as long as River.  River didn't get to be a dad, and River didn't get to have the experiences of the rollercoaster ride of the ups and downs of a profession. I almost feel sadder about his death now, because I'd love to know what he thinks now. He was such a political young man and he was such an idealist. I would love to see what that looked like at 55. And I would like to see the artist that he would be and the art he would have made. I can't believe that Phil's gone. Half of why I act sometimes is to impress those two men that I was friends with. I think about them all the time when I'm performing, because they were the gauge by which I judged myself — and they still are. <strong>On aging</strong> I feel a desire to work. … I feel I'm aware of how much of the road has already been walked and ... I'm very aware of how many more years I might have to contribute. And I don't like wasting time anymore. I'm aware of how many people mentored me and cared for me. And am I doing that for others? Am I meeting my responsibilities as a citizen? Not just as a father, which is obvious and omnipresent in my life. Those questions are on my mind all the time.  Then there's this other voice, which is, am I enjoying my life? Because I do want to enjoy it, too. And how much of this work that I'm obsessed with is eroding at my sense of play and joy and spontaneity and living and being in the moment. ... It is strange, the older you get, I have no awareness of wisdom, I only have awareness of how many things I thought I understood that I don't understand, and more questions come in the door, and that's kind of exciting. <em>Lauren Krenzel and Thea Chaloner</em><strong> </strong><em>produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

In this session, Nelson talks about why the more you travel, the more similarities you see in the people you meet; the genesis of the first song he ever wrote — later recorded by his father, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15396875/willie-nelson\" target=\"_blank\">Willie Nelson</a>; and he shares his stellar cover of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15168166/paul-simon\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Simon</a>'s \"Still Crazy After All These Years.\" <em>This episode of </em>World Cafe<em> was produced and edited by Miguel Perez.

    "title": "Michael Jackson sets a record on the pop charts, thanks to spooky season",
    "text": "Once again, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/120581188/taylor-swift\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor Swift</a> tops this week's <em>Billboard</em> albums and singles charts. Elsewhere, two holidays collide, as Halloween perennials coexist with the charts' first flurries of the Christmas season. Along the way, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/16782748/michael-jackson\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Jackson</a>'s \"Thriller\" shoots up the chart, making this the sixth consecutive decade in which Jackson has scored at least one top 10 hit. That's an all-time chart record. <h3>TOP STORY</h3> Before the streaming era, holidays rarely had much of an impact on <em>Billboard</em>'s Hot 100 singles chart. You'd see an occasional novelty hit here and there, but generally speaking, the Hot 100 in December didn't look all that different from the Hot 100 in, say, March. The streaming era has changed that radically — and in ways that extend well beyond Christmas time. Just this year, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1104559097/toby-keith\" target=\"_blank\">Toby Keith</a>'s <em>35 Biggest Hits</em> compilation <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/g-s1-77860/drake-toby-keith-kpop-demon-hunters-charts\" target=\"_blank\">zoomed back into the top 10</a> in the aftermath of July 4. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15402896/earth-wind-fire\" target=\"_blank\">Earth, Wind & Fire</a>'s <em>Greatest Hits</em> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559280/cardi-b-am-i-the-drama-charts\" target=\"_blank\">re-entered the <em>Billboard</em> 200</a> albums chart because so many fans like to stream the group's 1978 song \"September\" — with its famous question, \"Do you remember the 21st night of September?\" — on Sept. 21. And Halloween? Well, Halloween has become a musical season unto itself — for at least a few weeks, anyway. Last week's charts reflect the seven days immediately before Halloween — the \"spooky season,\" you might say, but not the holiday itself or the weekend that followed. And several titles did re-enter the charts, led by Michael Jackson's \"Thriller,\" which resurfaced on the Hot 100 at No. 32. This week's charts cover a seven-day stretch beginning with Halloween, so you get a full reflection of costume-party playlists and titles streamed on front porches for the benefit of trick-or-treaters. And, though it can't compare to the annual pre-Christmas onslaught, a handful of spooky and spookiness-adjacent songs do make their way back onto the Hot 100 this week. The songs themselves are more or less exactly what you'd expect: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2007/04/26/9852735/the-man-who-did-the-mash-the-monster-mash\" target=\"_blank\">Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett</a> & The Crypt-Kickers' \"Monster Mash\" (No. 21), Ray Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" (No. 22) and Rockwell's \"Somebody's Watching Me\" (No. 24) all reemerge from their respective crypts in lockstep, with The Citizens of Halloween's \"This Is Halloween\" (from <em>Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>) right behind them. But one Halloween jam outshines them all — and hits some massive milestones in the process. \"Thriller\" was the seventh single from Jackson's 1982 mega-blockbuster of the same name and hit No. 4 during its initial chart run. It became a durable classic — and Halloween staple — thanks to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA\" target=\"_blank\">its iconic video</a>, which premiered in December 1983. \"Thriller\" has re-entered the Hot 100 numerous times since then, most prominently in the aftermath of Jackson's death in 2009. This week, it jumps from No. 32 all the way to No. 10. For Jackson, that triggers a remarkable chart milestone: He's the first artist in history to hit the top 10 in <em>six different decades</em>. Before, he was tied with … who, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15229570/the-beatles\" target=\"_blank\">The Beatles</a>? Nope. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15624007/elvis-presley\" target=\"_blank\">Elvis Presley</a>? Nuh-uh. The answer is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2009/10/31/114361963/andy-williams-memoirs-of-moon-river\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Williams</a>, who had loads of hits in the '50s, '60s and '70s, then returned to the top 10 in the 2010s and 2020s thanks to the streaming-fueled holiday hit \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year.\" In Jackson's case, his six decades have been consecutive — and there's even a seventh with an asterisk, because <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/94109252/the-jackson-5\" target=\"_blank\">The Jackson 5</a> cracked the top 10 with \"I Want You Back\" in December 1969. Prior to this week's \"Thriller\" renaissance, Jackson's last appearance in the top 10 arrived thanks to his posthumous appearance in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/250250872/drake\" target=\"_blank\">Drake</a>'s 2018 hit \"Don't Matter to Me.\" Don't expect \"Thriller\" to remain in the top 10 now that Halloween is an increasingly distant memory. The spooky season is well and truly over, provided you don't look too closely at the Hot 100 and grimace in terror as you spy the song at No. 31. It's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15324690/mariah-carey\" target=\"_blank\">Mariah Carey</a>, who reenters the chart — earlier than ever — with \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" Eeeeeeeeeeeek! <h3>TOP ALBUMS</h3> For the fifth straight week, Taylor Swift's <em>The Life of a Showgirl</em> sits atop the <em>Billboard</em> 200 albums chart. But Swift's grip on the top spot would at least appear to be slipping, with several high-profile albums on the immediate horizon. Though she's yet to hit the <em>Billboard</em> 200's top 10 in her career, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/663524172/rosalia\" target=\"_blank\">Rosalía</a>'s <em>LUX</em> is due to hit next week's charts, and has gotten tremendous reviews. (Seriously, it's so great.) <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/761264020/summer-walker\" target=\"_blank\">Summer Walker</a>'s <em>Finally Over It</em> drops this Friday and will enter the <em>Billboard</em> 200 the following week. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/668309383/michael-bubl\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Bublé</a>'s <em>Christmas</em> has — <em>[emits deep, tortured sigh, followed by a three-minute stare, unblinking, into the middle distance]</em> — already reentered the chart at No. 65. <em>The Life of a Showgirl</em> easily survived this week's top new threat, as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/121555771/florence-and-the-machine\" target=\"_blank\">Florence + The Machine</a> debuted at No. 4 with a Halloween-friendly new album called <em>Everybody Scream</em>. And a huge chart leap for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/137321239/tyler-the-creator\" target=\"_blank\">Tyler, The Creator</a>'s <em>CHROMAKOPIA </em>— boosted by the release of deluxe editions surrounding the anniversary of its release — only sent it from No. 117 to No. 5. Still, for <em>The Life of a Showgirl</em> — and for those of us who toil aggressively to avoid exposure to Bublé's music — winter is coming. Case in point: There are now <em>four</em> Christmas albums on the <em>Billboard</em> 200. Bublé leads the way, followed by the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15396963/vince-guaraldi\" target=\"_blank\">Vince Guaraldi Trio</a>'s <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> (No. 85), Carey's <em>Merry Christmas</em> (No. 113) and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15182601/bing-crosby\" target=\"_blank\">Bing Crosby</a>'s <em>Ultimate Christmas</em> (No. 160). Whole lotta holiday-music enthusiasts are out there opening their gifts early this year. <h3>TOP SONGS</h3> Taylor Swift is a master of extending her chart runs, thanks to a deep bag of tricks that includes remixes, staggered releases on vinyl and CD, acoustic versions and more. The woman possesses a great many talents, but she's an all-timer when it comes to leveraging her fans' enthusiasm. On the albums chart, it's a challenge to extend <em>The Life of a Showgirl</em>'s run at No. 1, in part because she's already exhausted so many of those opportunities in the album's first week of release. The price of that record-setting sales week is that it gets harder and harder to go back to the well and sell fans more copies of the same album. But when it comes to \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" which tops the Hot 100 for a fifth straight week, she's still got some bullets in the chamber as she labors to remain ahead of two colossal hits. And she needs them, because the song isn't No. 1 in streaming <em>or</em> radio airplay this week. The top song on streaming is HUNTR/X's \"Golden,\" from the <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> soundtrack. When it comes to commercial radio airplay, the top song is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/g-s1-60448/alex-warren\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Warren</a>'s \"Ordinary,\" which is likely evident to anyone who's tried to listen to a commercial pop station since, say, June. But the former lags a bit in airplay, the latter lags a bit in streaming and \"The Fate of Ophelia\" leads the field in sales — an area where Swift's bag of tricks comes in especially handy. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" gets a boost this week from two alternate versions: an \"Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version\" that's padding her streaming and sales numbers, and a brand-new remix by the duo Loud Luxury that dropped on Nov. 6. Those moves were enough to keep the song atop the Hot 100 for another week, but as the holidays loom, all three songs face a force as predictable as the tides. Today, they're jockeying for the top of the charts; tomorrow, they'll all be eating <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15403632/paul-anka\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Anka</a>'s dust.",

And some impacts could continue much longer than six weeks, whether that's national parks trying to make up for lost visitor revenue or taxpayers waiting longer for refunds from a backlogged Internal Revenue Service (IRS). There's also the looming threat of another potential shutdown in the not-too-distant future, since this bill only funds the government through Jan. 30. Here's a look at where things stand for now. <em>Keep scrolling for updates, and jump by category here:</em> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5607812/government-shutdown-ends-updates#federal-workers\">Federal workers</a>| <a href=\"https://n.pr/47Gt3BX\">SNAP</a>|<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5607812/government-shutdown-ends-updates#smithsonian\"> Smithsonian</a> | <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5607812/government-shutdown-ends-updates#flying\">Air travel </a>| <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5607812/government-shutdown-ends-updates#parks\" target=\"_blank\">National parks</a> | <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5607812/government-shutdown-ends-updates#taxes\">Taxes</a> | <a href=\"https://n.pr/3LNR952\" target=\"_blank\">Economic data</a> <h3 id=\"backpay\">Federal employees return to work, awaiting back pay </h3> Roughly 1.4 million federal workers have gone without pay for six weeks. Roughly half of them were required to keep working without paychecks, while hundreds of thousands of others were furloughed. Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told agency heads to direct furloughed employees to return to work Thursday. \"Agencies should take all necessary steps to ensure that offices reopen in a prompt and orderly manner\" on Thursday, Vought wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/M-26-01-Reopening-Departments-and-Agencies.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Wednesday memo</a>. The timing of backpay is a different question. After the government shutdown ending in January 2019 — then the longest in history — Congress <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/24/text\" target=\"_blank\">passed a law</a> ensuring back pay for federal workers \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\" But Trump appeared to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/07/g-s1-92363/omb-memo-shutdown-federal-worker-backpay\" target=\"_blank\">suggest otherwise</a> in public comments last month, leaving many feds worried. The bill that Congress passed to end the shutdown guarantees back pay. It also reverses several agencies' attempted staffing reductions during the shutdown, which were <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5585083/government-shutdown-trump-rif-layoffs\" target=\"_blank\">paused by a federal judge</a>, and prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January. Shaun Southworth, a federal employment attorney, said in an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ9tSwCDZat/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram video</a> that the timing of backpay will vary by agency based on their payroll providers, but most employees should start seeing deposits within days. \"Many employees historically saw deposits within the first business days after reopening,\" he says of the last shutdown. \"A minority may roll to the next cycle if the system needs extra processing.\" <h3 id=\"snap\">SNAP is back </h3> The bill Congress passed to reopen the government funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 2026. The program, which some <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5581354/federal-shutdown-snap-wic-food-aid-ebt-hunger\" target=\"_blank\">42 million Americans rely on</a> for food assistance, has been the subject of much uncertainty — and an escalating legal battle — in recent weeks. The Trump administration said last month that it would suspend SNAP funding in November due to the shutdown, prompting a wide outcry and a series of legal challenges. While the administration initially said it would comply with two rulings requiring it to provide at least partial funding for SNAP in November, it balked — and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court — after one of those judges said it must fund the program fully for the month. The Supreme Court paused that order (and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/g-s1-97516/supreme-court-snap-payments-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">extended that pause again</a> on Tuesday, with the end of the shutdown in sight). At this point, beneficiaries in some states have gotten their full monthly allocations, while others have gotten partial payments or nothing at all. Reopening the government means restarting SNAP, but it's not clear how quickly full payments will resume, since that varies by state. And, as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5604788/snap-shutdown-anxiety-anger-may-linger\" target=\"_blank\">NPR has reported</a>, many who rely on the program are worried that benefits could be cut again. <h3 id=\"smithsonian\">Smithsonian institutions will reopen on a rolling basis</h3> The Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums and the National Zoo, says its reopening will be gradual. Its <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/visit/museums\" target=\"_blank\">website says</a> the National Museum of American History, as well as the National Air and Space Museum and its Virginia annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, will open their doors on Friday. All other museums and the zoo — including its beloved <a href=\"https://nationalzoo.si.edu/news/government-shutdown-faqs\" target=\"_blank\">live animal cams</a> — will reopen to the public \"on a rolling basis\" by Monday. <h3 id=\"flying\">Air travel won't bounce back overnight</h3> The shutdown snarled air travel in a tangle that experts say is beyond a quick fix. Escalating shortages of air traffic controllers — who have been required to work without pay — caused delays and disruptions at airports nationwide since early October. Then, last week, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5601894/air-travel-airports-flights-faa-reductions-what-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">reduce air traffic</a> at 40 of the country's busiest airports, starting by 4% and ramping up to 10% by this Friday. The FAA <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-faa-administrator-bryan-bedford-freeze\" target=\"_blank\">announced Wednesday</a> that it would freeze flight reductions at the current 6% level, citing a rapid improvement in controller staffing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers will get a lump sum payment equal to 70% of their <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/us-airline-flight-cancellations-fall-air-traffic-absences-shrink-2025-11-12/\" target=\"_blank\">back pay within 48 hours</a> of the shutdown ending. The agency says it will continue to assess \"whether the system can gradually return to normal operations.\" Airlines and aviation regulators have warned that flight <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5605538/air-traffic-control-flights-controllers-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">disruptions are likely to continue</a> once the government reopens. Airlines had to adjust their schedules to reduce flights, and those changes can take time to reverse. \"It's going to take a bit to unwind, and the responsibility is not going to fall completely on the air traffic control operation,\" former FAA administrator Randy Babbitt <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5605566/hundreds-of-flights-are-cancelled-as-air-traffic-controllers-work-without-pay\" target=\"_blank\">told NPR's <em>All Things Considered</em></a> on Tuesday. \"A good deal of responsibility will be the carriers getting their schedules and the aircraft and personnel back in the right positions to resume normal flying.\" Air travel experts have told NPR that even after the shutdown, lingering impacts could potentially complicate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5599582/government-shutdown-airport-thanksgiving-travel\" target=\"_blank\">Thanksgiving travel</a> — which is always a hectic time to fly. <h3 id=\"parks\">National Parks start to \"pick up the pieces\"    </h3> Most national parks <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/04/nx-s1-5562507/national-parks-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">stayed at least partially open</a> during the shutdown, but with significantly reduced staffing (since thousands of National Park Service employees were furloughed) and limited services like visitor centers and trash pickup. The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), a nonprofit that advocates for national parks, <a href=\"https://www.npca.org/articles/11207-parks-group-urges-congress-to-protect-national-park-funding-and-staffing-as\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a> that it could take months for returning staff to address the damage. \"For 43 days, many national parks were left open, vulnerable and unprotected,\" said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at NPCA. \"The National Park Service, already pushed to its breaking point after losing 25% of permanent staff, is left to pick up the pieces.\" National parks were already feeling the strain before the shutdown, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/23/nx-s1-5393641/trump-budget-cuts-national-parks-joshua-tree-safety\" target=\"_blank\">forced by federal funding cuts</a> to cancel ranger programs, close visitors centers and pause maintenance and research. During the shutdown, parks were unable to collect millions of dollars in entrance and recreational fees, which Brengel says could delay construction projects and other visitor services. And nonprofits which diverted resources to help parks stay operational have depleted their budgets in the process, Brengel says, leaving them \"unsure if they will ever fully recover those funds.\" Congress' bill funds the National Park Service through January. But Brengel calls it \"only a short-term reprieve,\" warning that another government shutdown could dampen the busy season by affecting the hiring of seasonal rangers for next spring and summer. <h3 id=\"taxes\">The IRS is looking ahead to tax filing season</h3> The IRS <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/29/nx-s1-5589165/furloughed-federal-employee-hot-dog-stand\" target=\"_blank\">furloughed nearly half</a> of its approximately 74,000 workers and tried to lay off <a href=\"https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2025/nov/almost-1400-irs-employees-receive-layoff-notices-adding-to-staff-losses/\" target=\"_blank\">roughly 1,400 others</a> — though those cuts were reversed as a result of the bill reopening the government. The agency's operations were <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/statement-on-irs-operations-limited-during-the-lapse-in-appropriations-regular-tax-deadlines-remain\" target=\"_blank\">limited during the shutdown</a>. It generally did not pay tax refunds during this period, scaled back its live telephone customer service supports, closed walk-in Taxpayer Assistance Centers and cancelled appointments related to cases with the Independent Office of Appeals and Taxpayer Advocate Service — which it says will be rescheduled once the government reopens. Tax deadlines and laws remain in effect, and the IRS says it has continued critical operations related to next year's tax-filing season. But some experts worry that the effects of the shutdown — on top of thousands of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/20/nx-s1-5304220/irs-job-cuts-doge-tax-season\" target=\"_blank\">IRS job cuts</a> enacted earlier this year — could make for a messy 2026 tax season. In an <a href=\"https://www.aicpa-cima.com/advocacy/download/aicpa-comment-letter-on-irs-relief-for-taxpayers-impacted-by-ongoing\" target=\"_blank\">October letter</a> to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) urged the IRS to take steps like pausing notice and collection activities during the shutdown. It wrote that since taxpayers can only respond to those by mail, the understaffed agency may not see their letters in time to fix errors or address issues — and will have to deal with an unwieldy backlog when the government reopens. \"This burden has the real potential to delay the 2026 filing season due to the increased stresses to our entire tax system,\" the accountants wrote. Such disruptions have happened before. The 2018-2019 shutdown left the IRS with over 5 million pieces of unprocessed mail, 80,000 unaddressed responses to Fiscal Year 2018 Earned Income Tax Credit audits and 87,000 amended returns waiting to be processed, <a href=\"https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ARC18_ExecSummary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">according to a report</a> by the National Taxpayer Advocate (an independent agency within the IRS). And years earlier, the 16-day government shutdown in October 2013 delayed billions of dollars of tax refunds and created a backlog of 1.2 million income and Social Security number verification requests, according to the <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/papers/government-shutdowns-qa-everything-you-should-know\" target=\"_blank\">Committee for a Responsible Budget</a>. <h3 id=\"Economic\" data>Delayed economic reports may never be released</h3> The shutdown could leave permanent gaps in economic data. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics typically releases employment reports on the first Friday of each month, a practice that was paused in October and November. Even with the government reopening, their future is uncertain. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"https://x.com/Acyn/status/1988676675601854727?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday that October's inflation and jobs reports will \"likely never [be] released and all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired.\" She blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which she said \"may have permanently damaged the federal statistical system.\" The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not commented publicly on the status of the reports or updated its calendar of upcoming release dates. Economists <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/2025111138/heres-when-to-expect-shutdown-delayed-jobs-and-inflation-reports-once-the-government-reopens\" target=\"_blank\">expect the bureau</a> to release its September jobs report (which was nearly ready when the government shut down on Oct. 1) first, and say it's an open question when — or whether — any October reports will be published.",

She recalls the blood, the cries and her own exhaustion. \"I hadn't eaten for over 12 hours, and my hands were shaking,\" says Kadiri, who was 28 at the time. \"Then an elderly cleaner, one of those invisible heroes in hospitals, walked up to me with a small nylon bag.\" Inside was a biscuit and a sachet of water. \"Doctor,\" she said, \"you need small strength to save people.\" \"It sounds simple, but I'll never forget it. That biscuit tasted like hope. Her kindness reminded me that healing isn't only about medicine, it's about humanity,\" says Kadiri. \"As a psychiatrist, I've seen it over and over: People don't just heal in hospitals, they heal in human connections.\" And while one isolated act of kindness may seem random, it can lead to much more. <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.linkedin.com/in/huguette-diakabana-516a4343/__;!!Iwwt!RNfITbS9QV5T81xPag2_3oVlSXKQqL7JvlPAu1q4WQeeQMYEviewKowhFKrv-gIvAKSVwCvXbGPBaCcBKNI61TTbyp94-Q$\" target=\"_blank\">Huguette Diakabana</a> remembers when she had to drop out of school at age 10 — until a mysterious donor came to her rescue. Her family was planning to emigrate to the U.S. from Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and couldn't afford school fees. They figured she'd make up the year later. She had a different idea: \"I put on my previous year's uniform and sat outside under the street window of my would-be classroom.\" One day, the director invited her inside. Diakabana realized someone must have paid her school fees, but who?  Returning to the school years later, Diakabana discovered it was a school guard. She wanted to repay him. \"He told me to help others when I could, so I launched a scholarship program,\" says Diakabana, who now lives in Switzerland and is co-founder of The Luminous Agency, which focuses on digital literacy. Dr. Junaid Nabi, a physician-scientist who conducts research in health care technology at the RAND School in Washington, D.C. and is a senior fellow at the Aspen Institute, says he's come to realize that kindness isn't actually a trickle in the ocean. An act of kindness is more like dropping a stone that creates expanding ripples,<strong> </strong>he says<strong>. </strong> \"There are <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0087275\" target=\"_blank\"><u>studies</u></a> that illustrate how kindness spreads through social networks in measurable ways. When we are kind to someone, they don't just feel better — they become 25% more likely to help others.\" One such investigation described how kindness can be contagious. It was sparked by reports of an outbreak of kindness on a cold December morning in 2012. A stranger picked up the tab for the coffee order of the next customer in the drive-through line at a Tim Hortons coffeehouse in Winnipeg, Canada. And that customer picked up the tab of the person behind him. In the end, 226 customers passed on this act of kindness. The study authors, citing other examples of \"pay it forward\" kindness at fast food restaurants and their own experiments encouraging subjects to help others, write: \"Why, in the absence of external sanctions and opportunities for reciprocation, do people help strangers? One possible explanation is that helping is driven by receiving or observing help. In other words, generosity towards strangers may be socially contagious.\" Says Nabi: Your kindness influences a friend, who influences their friend, who influences their friend. \"This creates what is often termed as '<a href=\"https://siyli.org/resources/blog/kindness-contagion\" target=\"_blank\"><u>social contagion.</u>'\"</a> It's like a positive feedback loop, Nabi says: Feeling cared for makes you want to care for others. The 2025 World Happiness <a href=\"https://www.worldhappiness.report/ed/2025/caring-and-sharing-global-analysis-of-happiness-and-kindness/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Report</u></a> surveyed people from 147 countries. Interviewees spoke a simple truth: Doing something kind with no motive for gain made them feel better.<strong> </strong> <h3><strong>Nature or nurture?</strong></h3> And where does kindness come from? Are you born with it? Or can you learn to be compassionate and empathetic? <a href=\"https://behavioralhealth.uth.edu/directory/profile?id=657528ac-ba40-4bc7-8463-26aa9ffd6e6e\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Jeff R. Temple</u></a>, a professor and psychologist with UTHealth Houston, says kindness is a central thread running through his studies on healthy relationships among adolescents and young adults. \"In our intervention work — including with the <a href=\"https://www.uth.edu/news/story/uthealth-houston-study-reveals-long-term-mental-health-benefits-of-healthy-relationship-skills-program-for-adolescents\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Fourth R program</u></a> and other school-based curricula — we teach adolescents to practice perspective-taking, to express care even during disagreement and recognize the impact of their words and actions. These are essentially the behavioral expressions of kindness.\" Such kids are less likely to bully others because they know what healthy relationships are like, he says. <h3><strong>A ripple effect</strong></h3> And let's not forget that kindness can change not only the life of the recipient of the kind deed but of the kind person, says Nabi, who offers this anecdote. In the 2013<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22476774\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Savar building collapse</u></a> in Bangladesh, where 1,040 garment workers were crushed under concrete. Rescue workers managed to pull out 2,400 people from the rubble two weeks after the collapse. Nabi arrived at the disaster site as a Red Cross volunteer, expecting to gain experience in trauma care. Instead, he says, the experience changed his psyche, teaching him about the nature of true kindness. \"In the midst of chaos, with bodies awaiting identification, kindness came down to being present during others' darkest moments,\" says Nabi. \"I performed CPR on workers I knew wouldn't survive. and when I couldn't save someone, I stayed by their side, holding their hand.\" \"Before Savar, I was mechanistic, rushing through clinical work like tasks,\" he recalls. \"The <a href=\"https://time.com/3387526/a-final-embrace-the-most-haunting-photograph-from-bangladesh/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>image of workers who had embraced each other</u></a> as concrete crushed them — that final act of human kindness in the face of death — shattered my callousness completely.\" When he returned to the hospital, he listened to patients differently, giving them more of his time. He also urges doctors to volunteer for humanitarian causes to practice compassion. \"Kindness, I learned, is about showing up completely for another person's suffering,\" Navi reflects, \"and letting that experience fundamentally change who you are.\" So if you began reading this story with the thought that World Kindness Day is … a gimmick … it is a gimmick imbued with heart and hope.  It's a good reminder to practice kindness more, Dr. Kadiri says. \"And here's the beautiful part: When someone receives kindness, they don't just feel better, they become better.\" They may be inspired to perform their own act of kindness. And that, she says, makes the world a kinder, better place too. <strong>Your turn:</strong> Readers! Have you ever had a life-changing moment because of an act of kindness.

Democrats and Republicans have differing views on what the documents say about Epstein. <ul><li>🎧 <strong>The majority of the emails were obsessively tracking Trump's ascent to the presidency from 2015 to 2018. </strong>Epstein mocked Trump and even wrote a note saying there isn't one decent cell in Trump's body to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, NPR's Stephen Fowler tells <em>Up First</em>. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the release of <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5607749:nx-s1-mx-5805006\" target=\"_blank\">the emails proves nothing</a>. House Speaker Mike Johnson has been opposed to the effort from some Republicans and Democrats to release all unclassified files held by the Justice Department around the life and death of Epstein, who died by suicide while awaiting trial in 2019.

Adelita Grijalva was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/12/nx-s1-5606350/adelita-grijalva-swearing-in\" target=\"_blank\">sworn into Congress yesterday</a>, meaning the bipartisan push now has enough support to force a House floor vote on the Epstein files bill.</li></ul> <strong>The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is now over after Trump signed a bill to fund it last night.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/12/g-s1-97607/house-vote-shutdown-end\" target=\"_blank\">The bill includes measures that</a> reverse the layoffs imposed by the Trump administration during the shutdown, provide back pay for federal employees, and fund some agencies through the end of next September. The bill does not extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which expire at the end of the year. <br> <ul><li>🎧 <strong>NPR's Barbara Sprunt says she is watching how Democrats will craft a bill that could appeal to Republicans</strong>, addressing the expiring subsidies during the promised December vote in the Senate on the issue. If they are successful, Democrats will be able to begin the new year with a policy victory. If Republicans oppose the bill, Democrats will have what they see as a <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5607749:nx-s1-mx-5805006\" target=\"_blank\">winning issue to campaign on</a>: the high cost of health care.</li><li>🎧<strong> There are signals that a one-year extension of the federal subsidies could be possible</strong>, but there is no concrete deal at this point, says NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Republicans say that the subsidies <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5607749:nx-s1-mx-5805006\" target=\"_blank\">don't address the rising health costs</a> and that they were supposed to be a temporary pandemic policy.

    "title": "'We need to get out of here': Trump's immigration crackdown is quietly reshaping where immigrants live in America",
    "text": "A woman named \"E\" was at a clothing store in Tampa, Florida with her daughter when she realized it was time to leave. It was her daughter's 15th birthday, and she wanted to buy her an outfit. She says she felt the salespeople giving them looks. \"Real ugly looks,\" she says. \"They could call immigration,\" she recalls telling her daughter. \"You're an American citizen, but you're also Hispanic. We need to get out of here.\" They left the store, she says, with the feeling that it was also time to leave the state. The question this family is grappling with is: where to? Under the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, many are deciding to hide in place, while others are self-deporting. But there's also anecdotal evidence that people are relocating, from cities with aggressive immigration enforcement to places with fewer raids, where they feel safer. E. asked that we only use her first initial, because she and her husband are both undocumented. She says she'd like to go back to Guatemala as soon as possible. Her daughter, who recently started high school, wants to stay<strong> </strong>in Florida<strong>.</strong> So does her husband, who feels that after some 20 years living in the U.S., this is home. But under the leadership of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, Florida has embarked on one of the strictest immigration crackdowns in the nation, vowing to lead the way in President Trump's campaign. Her husband's workplace - a construction site - was recently raided. He just happened to be out that day. And the family knows multiple people who've been deported, including their own church pastor. For now, the family has decided to leave Florida for a small town in Michigan. A neighbor friend, also an immigrant, just moved there. \"She called me recently,\" E. says, and she told me, 'why don't you come up here? Things are quiet here. You don't hear about raids. And I can find you a job.'\" It's hard to track the movement of undocumented immigrants throughout the U.S. There are no exact numbers. Demographer Matt Brooks at Florida State University studies <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ruso.12565\" target=\"_blank\"><u>these population flows</u></a>, and says we've been seeing clear trends since at least the 1980s. \"There's definitely a pattern and on the aggregate these patterns make a lot of sense.\" <strong> </strong> Brooks says immigration to the U.S. is often a multi-step process: migrants tend to first land in big cities, but in time they make<em> a second move</em>, increasingly to the South or the Midwest, seeking out jobs in agriculture or manufacturing. And, he says, sometimes there's a third move: away from immigration enforcement to<em> </em>cities and towns that seem safer. Brooks points to Mississippi as an example. In 2019, there was a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/07/749243985/mississippi-immigration-raids-net-hundreds-of-workers\" target=\"_blank\"><u>massive immigration raid </u></a>at multiple food-processing plants near Jackson. \"We know that immigrants have been leaving Mississippi ever since,\" he says. Following that raid, he points out \"the flow of immigrants out of MIssissippi is more than double the flow in.\" The Trump administration hasn't hit its first anniversary yet, but the immigration crackdown is already having widespread effects. The Department of Homeland Security claims <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/23/new-milestone-over-2-million-illegal-aliens-out-united-states-less-250-days\" target=\"_blank\"><u>1.6 million immigrants </u></a>have left the country voluntarily, what the administration calls self-deportation. There's also evidence of something else: internal migration, as families flee enforcement zones for safer ground. For a Salvadoran man in Omaha, Nebraska who asked to be referred to by his first initial, R., relocating to another state was a panicked, last minute decision. Over the summer, a major raid at a meat packing plant sent shockwaves throughout immigrant communities in Nebraska. The morning after, R. says he sat in the parking lot of his factory, debating whether to go into work or leave the state altogether. \"I feel that I'm in between a rock and a hard place,\" he told NPR.. He's asked for his full name to be withheld because he is worried for his safety, as he is seeking asylum in the U.S. from El Salvador's authoritarian government. He says to be sent back could be a death sentence. A few days later, R. was gone. He drove almost non-stop from Nebraska to North Carolina—21 hours behind the wheel, fueled by coffee and electrolytes. The destination: a small city his friend said was safe, where immigration raids were rare or non-existent. When he got there, he went straight to work at his new roofing gig. That was five months ago. NPR recently checked in with him. \"It's been quiet here,\" he says. He wouldn't say he's happy, but there are fewer Hispanics, \"so the town just isn't a big immigration enforcement target.\" At least for now. He's hoping it stays that way.",

The hail was the size of softballs. \"I was in the window, I was crying,\" remembers Soledad Avalos, who has lived with her husband in their home in Cozad for 35 years. \"Seeing all the damage [to] the cars and the house.\" When the sun came up, the extent of the damage became clear. Cozad is a small town of about 4,000 people, surrounded by corn fields. Crops were flattened. Virtually every vehicle parked outside that night had a broken windshield. Nearly every roof in town was leaking, or worse. Siding was missing, paint had been stripped away. The storm came from the northwest, and so nearly every northwest-facing window was cracked. Both the hospital and the school were in disrepair. \"Those softball-sized hail stones just punched a hole through the roof membrane, and water was just pouring through the ceiling like a waterfall, or a shower,\" says Robert Dyer, the CEO of the Cozad Community Health System, which runs Cozad Community Hospital, the only hospital in town. \"Tiles were coming down, hunks of old plaster. It was just pretty devastating.\" The hospital's emergency department had to shut down for several hours, and the building is still being repaired more than a year later. Hailstorms like the one that hit Cozad don't often make national headlines, because they are usually hyper-local events that hit just one town, or one neighborhood in a larger city. Most hailstorms don't cause enough damage to trigger federal disaster declarations, or make it onto official annual lists of major weather disasters. And they are generally less deadly than flash floods, hurricanes and wildfires. But extremely costly hailstorms are getting more likely in the United States, researchers warn. Across the central and eastern U.S., the weather conditions that can produce hail that's at least the size of a pool ball have gotten more common, according to Deborah Bathke, Nebraska's state climatologist. And the Great Plains are expected to have <a href=\"https://nsco.unl.edu/2024-nebraska-climate-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>more frequent hail</u></a> as the planet warms up. That risk is driving up the cost of home insurance in the middle of the country, saddling average Americans with huge bills. Areas with the most hail risk are seeing some of the fastest growing home insurance prices in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26217177-senate-the-climate-driven-insurance-crisis-is-here-and-getting-worse/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>according to</u></a> two landmark <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26217176-fio-us-treasury-2025-analyses-of-us-homeowners-insurance-markets-2018-2022-climate-related-risks-and-other-factors-2/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>federal reports</u></a> released in the last year. \"In the Midwest, you've seen a surprising increase in losses,\" says Robert Gordon, a senior vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the largest property insurance trade group. \"It's particularly the hail, the wind. A lot of damage to roofs.\" That escalating damage is a reminder that, as climate change drives more extreme weather, geography is no longer a guarantee of protection from skyrocketing insurance rates. <strong>Home insurance costs are skyrocketing in the middle of the U.S.</strong> The central United States is home to the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094718300744\" target=\"_blank\"><u>worst hail risk</u></a> on the planet. \"North America is the hail continent,\" explains Scott St. George, a climate scientist and the head of weather and climate research at WTW, an international risk analysis company. And he says hail is different from other types of severe weather because it does a lot of property damage without causing many fatalities. \"It basically damages anything that's outside. And we've got a lot of stuff in the way,\" according to St. George. \"There are more houses insured, more expensive cars. Roofs, siding, car windows and exteriors.\" That has led to enormous bills for property insurance companies. \"You've seen some really big losses coming out of hail, mostly in the U.S.\" says St. George. Last summer's hailstorm in Cozad caused an estimated $100 million in property damage, according to local insurance agent Brian Messersmith – an enormous sum for a town of just 4,000 people. And, in 2024, hail damage contributed to <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-us-catastrophes\" target=\"_blank\">$54 billion</a> in insured losses from severe convective storms in the U.S., which include severe thunderstorms and other storms capable of producing large hail, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-run think tank. With losses mounting, insurance companies have raised prices in recent years. Nationwide, the cost of insurance rose about 8% faster than inflation between 2018 and 2022, according to a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26217176-fio-us-treasury-2025-analyses-of-us-homeowners-insurance-markets-2018-2022-climate-related-risks-and-other-factors-2/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>major report</u></a> published by the Treasury Department in January.  The report found that the average price of property insurance in the Great Plains was significantly higher than the national average, with consumers in the Northern Plains paying about 20% more than the national average, and consumers in the Southern Plains paying more than 45% more. In Nebraska, the average cost of homeowners insurance this year is nearly $6,400, according to <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/?sub-id=kiplinger-us-1076745293412320183#cost-by-state\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Bankrate</u></a>. That's the highest in the country, and almost $4,000 above the national average. In September, the Treasury report was removed from the department's website by the Trump administration. The Treasury Department did not respond to questions from NPR about why it was removed. Hail risk is only one of many reasons that insurance is more expensive. The higher cost of labor, and of construction materials are also driving up insurance prices, says St. George. \"Insurance is very impacted by inflation,\" says Robert Gordon of the American Property and Casualty Insurance Association. \"So if inflation suddenly spikes, then insurance losses go up.\" And the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPUSI012011\" target=\"_blank\"><u>cost of building materials</u></a> has increased even more than other goods in recent years, he points out. <strong>Insurance companies are bringing in profits. Small towns are struggling</strong> Rising prices for homeowners appear to be translating into profits for the industry. After losing more than $10 billion in 2023, the industry saw $26 billion in profits in 2024, according to credit agency AM Best. Insurers say that's largely due to the severity of disasters in a given year. \"It can be a dramatic swing because some years you have huge catastrophes,\" says Gordon. When insurers raise prices, they are simply passing along the enormous costs of rebuilding from major disasters, he says. But high prices are hitting many homeowners hard, particularly in places with historically low cost-of-living, like Nebraska. \"Insurance in our state really has skyrocketed the past several years,\" says Josh Tapio, an insurance broker at All Lines Insurance in Omaha, Neb. A few years ago, an average homeowner would pay about $1,500 per year to insure their $300,000 home, Tapio says. Now, it costs between $3,000 to $4,500, a two or even threefold increase. \"There's a lot of sticker shock when somebody opens their renewal bill and they see that it's double from what they paid last year,\" Tapio says. His office has never been busier, as people shop around for a policy they can afford. The high cost of insurance can make property ownership untenable. Before the storm, longtime Cozad resident Jennifer McKeone owned two rental houses in town. The hail caused extensive damage to both, and her insurance company refused to keep insuring them. \"I scrambled to find insurance, and the only insurance I could find was going to raise the rent to the point where I didn't think the people who lived in the houses could afford it,\" McKeone says. She ended up selling the homes, because neither she nor her tenants could afford the insurance costs. <strong>Seniors are hit particularly hard by rising insurance costs</strong> In the year and a half since the storm hit Cozad, most of the broken windows have been replaced, and most of the leaking roofs have been repaired. \"The town is doing well,\" says McKeone, who runs the Cozad Development Corporation, a local group that builds housing in town and works with businesses. But under the surface, McKeone says, many are still trying to finish repairs to their homes. Seniors have been hit particularly hard, she says. Many older residents live on a fixed income from a pension or social security payments, and can't afford drastically higher bills. Baltazar and Soledad Avalos, whose home was severely damaged in the storm, have experienced insurance problems firsthand. The home that they've lived in for 35 years had an insurance policy, but that policy didn't cover the full cost of all the repairs to the roof, windows and siding. Baltazar is still out on a ladder most days, fixing damage at age 72. On top of that, the cost of their insurance has gone up by about 10%, which is significant for a retirement-age couple. Baltazar is retired, Soledad is still working. <strong>Insurance is more expensive, and it covers less</strong> One of the biggest complaints among Cozad residents is that, even as they shell out more for property insurance, that insurance is covering less. Many people in town now have policies with higher deductibles, meaning that they need to pay thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before the insurance kicks in. And many new policies also don't cover the full cost of replacing a damaged roof, which is often the most expensive repair after a hailstorm. Megan Fales has worked as an insurance agent in Cozad for more than a decade, and handles hundreds of home insurance policies in town. \"A lot of people have just gotten to the point where, like 'Let's just take a higher deductible,'\" she says, because it costs less each month, even though they agree to pay more for repairs if there's a future storm. She says many homeowners in the area hope to save money by doing repairs themselves, instead of relying on insurance to pay. Businesses in town are also paying more money for less coverage. After the storm destroyed the roof of the local hospital, the insurance company refused to renew the policy. The only policies available are more expensive, and also have a much higher deductible for the roof. That means the hospital must pay more each month for insurance, and also must keep more cash on hand in case there's another storm. In an effort to avoid catastrophic damage in future storms, the hospital's governing board chose to upgrade the building. Instead of simply replacing the damaged roof, they are investing in roof materials that can withstand high winds and small hail. That choice saved them money on their monthly insurance premium, Dyer says. But even with those savings, they are paying more money for less coverage, compared to two years ago. \"It's to a point of unsustainability,\" says Dyer. \"If we got hit by another storm right now, it would drain all our cash.\"<br> <em>NPR's Robert Benincasa contributed to this story.</em>",

    "title": "Israel deported Palestinian prisoners to Egypt. Some Israelis question the practice",
    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel — In exchange for Hamas freeing its final group of Israeli hostages, Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinians from prison in October. Most of the Palestinians released by Israel had been arrested in Gaza on suspicion of taking part in hostilities during the war and held without charge, and they were sent back to the territory. But 250 of them were serving long sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. For 154 of those prisoners, their freedom came with a major condition: They were sent into exile, never to return to their homes in the Palestinian territories. They were sent to Cairo, with their final destination still undetermined. Israeli security experts say the deportation policy is intended to prevent released prisoners from returning to militant activity and posing a future threat to Israelis. But past cases suggest the policy of deporting Palestinian prisoners abroad can have unintended, long-term consequences for Israeli security. <h3>Hamas leaders behind the Oct. 7 attack were released prisoners</h3> Two prisoners released by Israel in a 2011 prisoner-hostage swap with Hamas ended up taking leadership roles with the militant group after being released, according to Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency. Zaher Jabarin, deported to Turkey, began overseeing Hamas' financial operations, the Shin Bet said <a href=\"https://www.shabak.gov.il/en/reports/publications/%D7%9B%D7%9A-%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%AA-%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%A1-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%AA-%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%94/\" target=\"_blank\">in a report</a>. Another, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/17/nx-s1-5155887/hamas-yahya-sinwar-israel-gaza\" target=\"_blank\">Yahya Sinwar</a>, became the Hamas leader in Gaza who orchestrated the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel — when 1,144 Israelis were killed, according to Israeli government figures, sparking the Gaza war. Another notable case is Saleh al-Arouri, a founding commander of Hamas' military wing. He was released from Israeli prison and deported in 2010. Settling first in Syria and later moving between Turkey, Lebanon and Qatar, he is widely credited with building Hamas' West Bank militant networks and helping plan the Oct. 7 attack. <h3>A mastermind of Hamas' hostage-taking strategy is now free</h3> Among the prisoners released in October and deported are those responsible for some of the most notorious attacks against Israelis in recent decades. One is Mahmoud Issa, who founded a Hamas unit decades ago that was responsible for abducting Israeli soldiers to use them as bargaining chips for pushing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners. He was arrested in 1993 and sentenced to life imprisonment, convicted for abducting and killing an Israeli police officer. Another is Imad Qawasmeh, a Hamas operative sent abroad in the recent deal, who was incarcerated for more than 20 years in connection with a pair of suicide bombings that killed 16 Israelis in the southern city of Beersheba in 2004. <h3>The Israeli debate about deporting Palestinian prisoners</h3> Some Israeli security analysts say deporting high-risk prisoners abroad is better than allowing them to return to their families and communities in the Palestinian territories. They argue that the distance reduces the released prisoners' ability to resume operational roles in militant groups like Hamas. Deportation can also decrease the influence they have on Palestinian communities in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, where they could otherwise inspire further violence toward Israel, said Michael Milshtein, an Israeli expert in Palestinian affairs at Tel Aviv University and former Israeli military intelligence officer. \"It can be better than having them here, mainly when it comes to those who are very experienced, admired and will contribute significantly to the terror infrastructure,\" said Kobi Michaeli, an Israeli security expert with the Institute for National Security Studies and the Misgav Institute think tanks. <h3>The effect of deportation, from a Palestinian perspective</h3> Palestinian human rights advocates criticize the deportations, which prisoners agreed to under conditions of imprisonment, as forcible displacement. Israeli analysts defend the practice, saying prisoners were offered a choice to remain incarcerated or be freed and deported. The majority of Palestinian prisoners' close relatives were barred by Israeli authorities from traveling abroad to greet their deported relatives after the most recent prisoner release, according to Qadura Fares, a veteran Palestinian prisoner advocate and the former head of prisoner affairs for the Palestinian Authority. Fares says the families were told the restriction was for security reasons. Fares himself was imprisoned in Israel in 1981, charged with being part of a militant squad that obtained weapons and conducted attacks, and was released to the West Bank in 1994 as part of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. \"Every prisoner dreams of being free in his own environment, in his town or village, among his family and friends, where people know him and where he has personal and social status,\" Fares told NPR. \"Israel thinks that it can distance these people from their homeland in order to stop them from influencing their societies, but it is a mistake. If a prisoner is released to a normal and familiar environment, he adapts and lives a normal life.\" But Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency suggests otherwise. A report by the Israeli parliament's research arm, The Knesset Research and Information Center, cites Shin Bet figures that <a href=\"https://fs.knesset.gov.il/globaldocs/MMM/23074ae6-916e-ef11-8163-005056aa4246/2_23074ae6-916e-ef11-8163-005056aa4246_11_20865.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">about 75%</a> of the Palestinian prisoners released in the 2011 prisoner-hostage deal returned to militant activity. The figures do not account for prisoners who are no longer alive. When asked whether deportation could serve as a form of punishment, Michaeli dismissed the idea: \"I think that for these people to live in Doha or in Istanbul under the hospitality of the [Qataris] and the Turks, is not a punishment.\" The Shin Bet declined NPR's request for comment on Israel's deportation policy. <h3>The impact of Israel's recent strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar</h3> If released prisoners end up in cities like Qatar's capital of Doha, or Istanbul and Ankara in Turkey, they could be in \"safe zones\" enabling released prisoners to operate more freely and play a future role in groups like Hamas, Michaeli explained. \"They have a sort of immunity, because Israel will not target them, at least not under the current circumstances,\" Michaeli said. Israel is widely believed to be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/02/25/124084062/hamas-assassination-draws-wide-praise-in-israel\" target=\"_blank\">behind one assassination</a> of a Hamas figure in a Gulf state in the past, but its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5535210/israel-qatar-hamas-doha\">strike in September on Hamas leaders</a> in Qatar angered the U.S. and \"was a lesson for Israel: You cannot really assassinate anyone in Hamas any place you want, because there is a price for moves like that,\" said Milshtein. Israel could pursue these individuals abroad at a later date, but the large-scale release of high-profile prisoners will place a heavy burden on Israel's intelligence agencies, requiring ongoing surveillance to prevent future attacks, writes Israeli analyst<a href=\"https://jcpa.org/israels-mossad-aims-to-thwart-terrorist-attacks-abroad-by-released-palestinian-terrorists/\" target=\"_blank\"> Yoni Ben Menachem</a> of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a conservative Israeli think tank. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo told NPR that the 154 prisoners deported last month were initially put up in Renaissance Cairo Mirage City Hotel, a high-end Marriott hotel. But after the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15223429/Hamas-dangerous-terrorists-released-Israel-staying-luxury-resort.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Daily Mail</em> reported</a> on their location, dubbing it \"Hotel Hamas,\" they were transferred to another hotel along the Gulf of Suez in the city of Ain Sokhna, about an hour and a half outside of Cairo, the embassy said. Israel and Egypt have not commented on their ultimate destination. <em>Nuha Musleh in Ramallah, West Bank, Ahmad Abuhamda in Cairo and Daniel Estrin in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this story.</em>",

But suspending funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP, may have long-lasting impacts, say some experts and those who depend on the program to feed their families.<strong>   </strong> Jacqueline Giammona, a single working mom of two boys, relies on SNAP for most of her groceries. By last week, her pantry and freezer were near empty.<strong> </strong> The Sacramento, Calif., resident was among those in some states who saw November benefits hit the EBT card they use to buy food, amid back-and-forth legal wranglings that reached the Supreme Court. \"I was really relieved,\" she said, but there was a nagging feeling in her gut. \"Okay, what if they take it away?'\" Giammona<strong> </strong>can't fathom why the government would deprive low-income people of a necessity like food. She considers it an \"abuse of power\" with lasting consequences. \"People are going to distrust the government, and I think that people are going to be really angry about it for a long time,\" she said. SNAP is the country's largest anti-hunger program, serving the 1 in 8 U.S. residents who live at or just above the poverty line. For more than 60 years it has stood as a key safety-net for those in need. Funded each year by Congress, its budget is designed to grow and shrink to meet the demand. To see it compromised was startling, said Craig Gundersen, an economics professor at Baylor University. \"This is a big surprise,\" Gundersen said.<strong> </strong>\"It really has broken this entitlement status of SNAP, and that's of concern.\" President Donald Trump has been a critic of SNAP. During the shutdown, he called it out as one of the \"Democrat programs\" he pledged to cut. On his social media platform Truth Social he falsely claimed former President Joe Biden randomly gave benefits \"to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need.\" In late October, as the government shutdown wore on, the U.S. Department of Agriculture posted on its website that it would not pay the full $8 billion in SNAP benefits due for November. The message blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the consequent suspension of payments. Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, said she felt \"shock, outrage, disbelief.\" \"It was a policy choice that was made by this administration,\" she said. The administration challenged the ruling of three lower courts that it had reserve funds to pay full SNAP benefits, arguing it needed the money for other children nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department said it had about $4.5 billion in a contingency fund that would<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5596121/snap-food-benefits-trump-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\"><u> </u>cover roughly half </a>of November's benefits. Two judges said the administration should tap other reserves to make up the difference.   The deal cut by Congress to reopen the government funds SNAP through September 2026. But FitzSimons is nervous that the program could be used again as a negotiation tactic. \"Once you break a taboo,\" she said, \"it's that much easier to break a taboo.\" Ideally, she'd like to see lawmakers pass a bill to ensure there is no future delay in SNAP benefits, even in a government shutdown. \"Could Congress compel USDA to actually act? They could,\" she says. \"I'm not sure that we'll be able to get that done before Oct. 1, 2026.<strong>\"</strong> Some advocates also worry the SNAP disruption will dissuade people who face hunger from getting help.<strong> </strong> \"By making SNAP payments uncertain the shutdown will likely further decrease the number of eligible people who will apply,\" said Joel Berg, CEO of the nonprofit Hunger Free America. The Agriculture Department did not respond to an NPR request for comment about concerns over mistrust in the program<strong> </strong>and plans to address that. The weeks of hardship, anxiety and chaos caused by the funding pause have, however, shined a light on the importance of the program, many noted. SNAP recipients have seen an outpouring of support from people around the country and lawmakers from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/opinion/josh-hawley-snap.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>both major parties</u></a>.<strong> </strong> \"If anything, I think that this shutdown and this disruption of SNAP benefits will make Americans more aware this is really an important program and should retain its entitlement status,\" said Gundersen. Brittany Jansen, of Phoenix, hopes more people will realize hunger affects those close to them. Jansen applied for SNAP benefits 10 months ago, after she and her partner racked up thousands of dollars in credit card debt for groceries and gasoline. He changed career paths and has yet to find a full-time job. She bartends part-time, and they split shifts because they can't afford child care for their two toddlers. Her own mother didn't fully grasp the struggle. \"When I first told her that we were getting benefits she was confused,\" Jansen said, \"because she was like, 'Well, you both have jobs!'\" Since the shutdown and SNAP funding pause, Jansen has been more open about the fact that her family needs help. \"And I think people are just kind of surprised,\" she said.",

    "title": "Why more than 1,000 musicians are boycotting Israel with 'No Music for Genocide'",
    "text": "Since September, more than 1,000 artists and labels including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/227790178/lorde\" target=\"_blank\">Lorde</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15191158/bjork\" target=\"_blank\">Björk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/17093791/massive-attack\" target=\"_blank\">Massive Attack </a>have joined an international initiative to remove their music from Israel. The boycott, called No Music for Genocide, is straightforward: artists are asking their labels and distributors to geo-block their music so it cannot be streamed in Israel. According to the movement's <a href=\"https://nomusicforgenocide.org/#page-1-1\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, this act is \"just one step toward honoring Palestinian demands to isolate and delegitimize Israel.\" Despite a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/29/nx-s1-5588710/israeli-prime-minister-orders-new-strikes-on-gaza-just-weeks-into-ceasefire-deal\" target=\"_blank\">fragile ceasefire</a> currently in place, No Music for Genocide organizers say they're continuing the boycott amidst <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/29/g-s1-95523/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire\" target=\"_blank\">additional airstrikes</a> in Gaza. \"Boycott is one of the most effective and enduring efforts that one can take to fight a militarized, overtly violent, three-headed monster of a system,\" blues poet <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1180152703/aja-monet\" target=\"_blank\">Aja Monet</a>, one of the participants, tells NPR. \"We're in a place where capitalism rules everything. The most effective thing we can do is to be strategic about where we put our resources.\" The musicians' coalition coincides with a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5535578/hollywood-stars-boycott-israeli-film-companies-in-response-to-gaza-crisis\" target=\"_blank\">similar pledge</a> from some <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5536976/einbinder-bardem-israeli-film-boycott-gaza\" target=\"_blank\">Hollywood stars</a> to boycott Israel's state-funded film industry. In September, an independent United Nations commission of inquiry <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5543246/israel-genocide-gaza-united-nations\" target=\"_blank\">concluded</a> that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and that countries helping to arm the Israeli government, like the United States, are complicit in the violence. Israel strongly denies that it is committing genocide — and some Israelis say the artists' efforts are misguided, because the boycott affects even those who oppose the war. In a statement to NPR, the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. condemned the musician-led protest. \"The attempt to boycott Israeli culture under the banner of 'No Music for Genocide' is discriminatory, immoral and misguided,\" reads the statement. \"Such boycotts do nothing to advance peace or improve the lives of either Israelis or Palestinians. On the contrary, they deepen division and harm the very people they claim to support.\" Although the State Department also rejected the U.N. report, some American musicians are demanding action and accountability over the U.S. government's role in the attacks. \"As a U.S citizen, I have a connection to this genocide that is happening using my tax dollars. As a musician, I am sensitive — I think that is necessary for making art,\" composer and singer-songwriter <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/142890546/julia-holter\" target=\"_blank\">Julia Holter</a>, another participant in the campaign, said in a statement shared with NPR. \"Every day for over a year and a half now, we have seen horror stories abound in Gaza, and every malnourished baby I see with horrific injuries, every mother or father I see hovered over their child targeted by a sniper makes me think of my child, makes me think of anyone I have ever loved. I feel a responsibility to do something, however small it may be.\" <h3>Historic precedents </h3> The No Music for Genocide movement, which is a decentralized volunteer network of musicians and labels, cites the success of cultural boycotts against South Africa during apartheid as a major inspiration. While artists like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/14899881/hugh-masekela\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Masekela</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/96810385/miriam-makeba\" target=\"_blank\">Miriam Makeba</a> made music a core tenet of anti-apartheid activism, international artists also played an important role. In 1985, E Street Band guitarist <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/17675728/steven-van-zandt\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Van Zandt</a> led dozens of musicians, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/14837922/bruce-springsteen\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15368370/miles-davis\" target=\"_blank\">Miles Davis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15283727/ruben-blades\" target=\"_blank\">Rubén Blades</a>, in the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/250015790\" target=\"_blank\">Artists United Against Apartheid</a> effort to record \"Sun City.\" The hit single referred to a luxury whites-only resort where artists including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/90283085/queen\" target=\"_blank\">Queen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/15335239/linda-ronstadt\" target=\"_blank\">Linda Ronstadt</a> had performed; the song's lyrics criticized their actions and pledged to avoid playing there until the end of apartheid. In 2023, artists ranging from Pedro Pascal to Quinta Brunson called for a <a href=\"https://www.artists4ceasefire.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ceasefire</a> amidst the conflict in Gaza, but No Music for Genocide is a musician-led boycott. In a statement shared with NPR, vocalist, guitarist and boycott participant Marisa Dabice of the band <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/498248708/mannequin-pussy\" target=\"_blank\">Mannequin Pussy</a> said mainstream artists could make a real difference. \"Without the participation of major label artists, this boycott cannot grow in the way it needs to make the largest possible impact,\" she wrote. \"We live in a day and age where unified direct action can make an impact —- we just have to be focused and unrelenting.\" The No Music for Genocide website notes that all three major U.S. labels — Sony Music, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/03/10/1085814568/sony-warner-universal-russia\" target=\"_blank\">ceased</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/03/10/1085814568/sony-warner-universal-russia\" target=\"_blank\">operations</a> in Russia shortly after the invasion of Ukraine and pledged to support humanitarian relief efforts. The group argues the same should be done on behalf of Palestinians. No Music for Genocide note that violence against Palestinians has continued since the ceasefire in Gaza and that their campaign will not stop \"until Palestinians achieve their rightful struggle for return, self-determination, and liberation,\" according to a statement shared with NPR. \"NMFG is just one tangible act of solidarity in a music industry rife with complicit businesses and institutions, and we're grateful so many artists and labels around the world are on the same page.\" Yasir Razak of the shoegaze band Nabeel, one of the artists geo-blocking his music from Israel, says he sees a link between the war in Gaza and the way Western powers have historically intervened in the Middle East. Razak was born in Baghdad around the time of the first Gulf War and grew up in the U.S. during the Iraq War. Although the Iraq War and the current conflict are markedly different, he says, they're not entirely separate. \"What makes me most sad is the idea that folks in other countries can't be seen,\" he says, adding that this is often the case with people from the Middle East. \"We've gone to great lengths to dehumanize them to the point where we can carry out these kinds of attacks against the majority popular opinion.\" In September, a <em>New York Times</em> and Siena University <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/30/polls/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html\" target=\"_blank\">poll</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/polls/israel-gaza-war-us-poll.html\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that a majority of American voters oppose continued U.S. economic and military support for Israel in the war, a reversal from public opinion shortly after the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on Oct. 7 in 2023, which killed 1,200 people according to the Israeli government. In July, a Gallup poll <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/692948/u.s.-back-israel-military-action-gaza-new-low.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that 60% of Americans disapprove of Israel's military actions in Gaza which have killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Razak says he has mostly received positive feedback from his fans for participating in the boycott. One downside, he notes, is that some digital service providers include Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories in the geo-block as part of Israel. After hearing directly from an affected listener, Razak found a workaround to provide free downloads of his music on the music distribution platform Bandcamp. But he says beyond the logistics of where the music is or isn't accessible, there is an underlying anxiety that comes with publicly voicing his stance against the Israeli state. (Several artists NPR reached out to declined to comment on the boycott). \"Ultimately, this is a humanitarian issue. We've all been seeing videos coming out of Gaza. We've heard members of the Israeli government speaking about what their intentions are. I think any right-minded person would look at that and say this is something to take a stand against,\" Razak says. \"But the attempt to conflate that in any way with hatred or antisemitism has been so dangerous and paralyzing, and fear-inducing for those of us who really feel like there's a moral obligation for us to stand against.\" <h3>Backlash against musicians</h3> In April, Cornell University dropped R&B singer <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/640259325/kehlani\" target=\"_blank\">Kehlani</a> as the headliner of a campus concert. In a <a href=\"https://statements.cornell.edu/2025/20250423-slope-day-concert.cfm#:~:text=Kehlani%20as%20this%20year's%20headliner%20has%20injected,reason%2C%20I%20am%20rescinding%20Kehlani's%20invitation%20and\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>, University President Michael I. Kotlikoff wrote that Kehlani \"espoused antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media.\" Kehlani has been an outspoken advocate for Palestinians; the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpI7ekFG8A0\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> for their 2024 song \"Next 2 U\" features a quote from Palestinian-American poet Hala Alyan, along with the phrase \"Long Live the Intifada.\" (The Arabic word generally translates to \"uprising\" and has a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/04/nx-s1-4958278/intifada-chants-pro-palestinian-protests-israel\" target=\"_blank\">long history</a> within the context of the war in Gaza.) During their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIY_lEg8kBA\" target=\"_blank\">performance</a> at NPR's Tiny Desk last year, Kehlani wore a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1216150515/keffiyeh-hamas-palestinians-israel-gaza\" target=\"_blank\">keffiyeh</a> — the traditional Arab headdress that's become a symbol for Palestinians — and stopped to address the audience. \"I want to take a second to say: Free Palestine. Free Congo. Free Sudan. Free Yemen. Free Hawaii. Free Guam,\" Kehlani said. \"It's deeper than this. I need everybody that's here right now, everybody that's watching, to step up, to use their voices.\" After Cornell's decision, New York nonprofit City Parks Foundation, which organizes the SummerStage concert series, also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/nyregion/kehlani-concert-central-park-canceled.html\" target=\"_blank\">cancelled</a> Kehlani's scheduled Pride performance following pressure from the mayor's office and citing \"security concerns.\" Brooklyn-based rapper <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/1239879713/mike\" target=\"_blank\">MIKE</a>, who is participating in No Music for Genocide, curates an annual hip-hop festival in partnership with SummerStage. He tells NPR he cancelled this year's edition in solidarity with Kehlani. \"You have to sacrifice for a bigger purpose,\" he says. \"One of the things that I see people trying to do with hip-hop is further detach it from its political foundation, its anti-establishment foundation.\" MIKE says music played a key role in shaping his political awareness, and he hopes his involvement in the geo-block movement stirs something in listeners. He's already received messages from fans in Israel over the removal of his music; he says he hopes the boycott inspires deeper reflection on the oppression of Palestinians and all peoples. <h3>Impact on Israeli music fans</h3> But on the ground in Israel, the boycott has led to some confusion. Linda Dayan, a reporter for <em>Haaretz</em> based in Tel Aviv, says that while most participating artists' music has been pulled from SoundCloud, several discographies are still available on other streaming platforms like Spotify. Dayan says blocking the music is \"just a punishment\" for the many Israelis who have long-opposed the war in Gaza. \"I think if [artists] really do want to make an impact, they should be putting their money behind their morals when it comes to either donating to initiatives that ensure that Gazans can get the aid that they so badly need, and organizations — especially within Israel — who are doing this work on the ground, who are organizing these protests,\" Dayan says. She points to groups like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/10/25/1208227647/israel-gaza-hamas-jewish-palestinian-peace-activists-lod\" target=\"_blank\">Standing Together</a>, a grassroots organization of Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel working to promote peace and unity. Dayan says she worries that instead of bringing people together, the boycott could further alienate Israelis. \"There is a really big narrative among the Netanyahu government and among factions of the right: 'They don't hate you because of what we do, they hate you because of who you are,'\" Dayan says. \"These boycotts that target wide swathes of people without considering the work that they're personally doing with Palestinians, the work that they are doing against the government or toward a just peace is giving credence to that idea.\" For several participating artists, No Music for Genocide is not an end-all solution, but they say it's an important form of nonviolent action. Aja Monet says the boycott is only one part of a much larger collective resistance. \"Just as much as we're talking about what's happening in Palestine, we're talking about the rising state of fascism in this country,\" she says. \"We're talking about poverty. We're talking about the books that are being banned. We're talking about the immigrant community that's being attacked and kidnapped from their homes in their street corners. All of this is from the same arm of violence and threat and terror. All of those things concern us and we want an end to it.",

    "title": "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants",
    "text": "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday. The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns. \"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\" Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV. Still, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement. \"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Richards said. Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns. Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply. The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner. Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal. Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days. Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired — sometimes years after. Newsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.",

    "title": "The longest government shutdown in U.S. history comes to a close",
    "text": "President Trump has signed a bill to fund the government, bringing a close to the longest government shutdown in history, one that saw millions of Americans affected and ended with little political gain. The bill passed Wednesday night<strong> </strong>despite Republicans' narrow margin in the House. Six Democrats<strong> </strong>joined their Republican colleagues to get the bill over the finish line 43 days after the shutdown began: Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Adam Gray of California, Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Tom Suozzi of New York. Two Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida -- voted no. The final vote was 222 to 209. President Trump signed the bill shortly after the House vote. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown at the signing event in the Oval Office.  \"This was an easy extension but they didn't want to do it the easy way,\" Trump said. \"They wanted to do it the hard way.\" In addition to extending last year's spending levels through the end of January for most of the government, the bill provides funding for some agencies through the end of next September, including payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The program, which provides food aid to nearly 1 in 8 Americans, has been mired in a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/09/nx-s1-5603417/full-snap-benefits-trump-states-order\" target=\"_blank\"><u>court battle</u></a> because of the shutdown. The bill includes a measure to reverse layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown, provides backpay for federal employees, and institutes protections against further layoffs. But the central issue underlying the entire shutdown — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/04/nx-s1-5562517/aca-obamacare-shutdown-trump-naic-health-insurance\" target=\"_blank\"><u>extensions on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year</u></a> — is not addressed in the bill. Instead, as part of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/10/g-s1-97245/senate-shutdown-vote\" target=\"_blank\"><u>deal reached with a bipartisan contingent of senators</u></a>, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote in mid-December on Democrat-drafted legislation aimed at extending those subsidies. That doesn't sit well with many Senate Democrats, who remain wary of the pledge. \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., who voted against the measure. Even if a December bill addressing the expiring subsidies passes the Senate, it would need to go to the House. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not made a guarantee to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote. <h3>A lot of pain, not a lot of gain</h3> Government shutdowns historically have not been effective tools for advancing a party's policy goals. The last six weeks proved that to be the rule, not an exception. The decision by Senate Democrats not to fund the government before Oct. 1 was fueled, at least in part, by demands from the Democrats' political base to be a strong opposition party. The party homed in on a promise that they would not fund the government unless Republicans agreed to extend subsidies for people who buy health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The decision came after key Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/nx-s1-5327600/house-democrats-outrage-spending\" target=\"_blank\"><u>voted alongside Republicans to avoid a shutdown</u></a> in March. The result was a furious Democratic base, who demanded the minority party exert what little leverage it has to force a negotiation with Republicans in exchange for their votes to fund the government. With an eye toward the expiring subsidies and resulting skyrocketing premiums, Senate Democrats stood firm during the October shutdown, hoping their resolve, paired with the devastating impacts of the shutdown on millions of Americans, would bring Republicans to the negotiating table. But the strategy ultimately didn't work. Republicans didn't budge and continued to hold regular votes to fund the government. In the meantime, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5581354/federal-shutdown-snap-wic-food-aid-ebt-hunger\" target=\"_blank\"><u>42 million Americans who participate with SNAP</u></a> didn't receive the food aid they rely on. Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees had to remain on the job without pay, leading to the Federal Aviation Administration's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5601586/flight-cuts-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\"><u>order to scale back flights</u></a>. Millions of federal workers went without pay. The group of seven Democrats and one independent senator who voted to end the shutdown acknowledged that waiting longer wouldn't bring about a different result. \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR. The result is an end to a shutdown that does not address the core demand from Democrats on the subsidies. Instead they are left to defend the kind of handshake agreement that they once said was insufficient. Thune's ultimate deal with Democrats aligns with his repeated statements throughout the shutdown that Republicans would be open to negotiating on the expiring subsidies only after the government was funded, not before. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, one of the six Democrats who voted for the bill in the House, said there is still an opportunity to address health care. \"Congress still has a window to pass bipartisan legislation to extend the ACA premium tax credits,\" Golden said in a statement. \"In September, I joined a bipartisan coalition in the House to put forth legislation to extend the credits for one year and now, with the shutdown now over, I urge members of both parties who care about affordable health care to come back to the table so we can get the job done.\" Another factor that didn't go Democrats' way is the president himself. President Trump has been known at times to upend Congressional Republicans' game plan. But he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/01/nx-s1-5593444/trump-government-shutdown-travel\" target=\"_blank\"><u>took a step back</u></a> during the shutdown and let Thune drive the GOP strategy. He didn't take the bait from Democrats who <a href=\"https://boyle.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/boyle-statement-trump-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5596397/house-democratic-whip-katherine-clark-on-how-she-thinks-the-shutdown-will-end\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> <a href=\"https://www.schiff.senate.gov/news/press-releases/statement-sen-schiff-blasts-republicans-refusal-to-negotiate-as-fourth-government-shutdown-under-president-trump-begins/\" target=\"_blank\">where</a> <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/schumer-blames-trump-shutdown-after-backs-meeting-democrats/story?id=125858454\" target=\"_blank\">Trump</a> \"the great negotiator\" was in the discussions. <h3>What happens now? </h3> Both parties have significant choices ahead that could lay the groundwork for their political successes and headaches through next year. Senate Democrats have about a month to craft a bill that addresses the expiring ACA subsidies in a way that brings enough Republicans on board for passage. If they're successful at getting an extension, Democrats will be able to start 2026 with a policy victory in hand that will shape their messaging going into the midterm elections. If Republicans don't support it, Democrats still have what they see as a winning issue — health care — to run on next year. Some Republicans have shown <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5596472/government-shutdown-record-health-care-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\"><u>interest</u></a> in addressing the subsidies, but want to institute reforms like fraud prevention and income caps. And both parties have to contend with the fact that the government is only funded for a few months. Congress will still have to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution ends.<br>",

    "title": "U.S. bishops officially ban gender-affirming care at Catholic hospitals",
    "text": "U.S. Catholic bishops voted Wednesday to make official a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender patients at Catholic hospitals. The step formalizes a yearslong process for the U.S. church to address transgender health care. From a Baltimore hotel ballroom, the bishops overwhelmingly approved revisions to their ethical and religious directives that guide the nation's thousands of Catholic health care institutions and providers. More than one in seven patients in the U.S. are treated each day at Catholic hospitals, according to the Catholic Health Association. Catholic hospitals are the only medical center in some communities. Major medical groups and health organizations support gender-affirming care for transgender patients. Most Catholic health care institutions have taken a conservative approach and not offered gender-affirming care, which may involve hormonal, psychological and surgical treatments. The new directives will formalize that mandate. Bishops will have autonomy in making the directives into law for their dioceses. \"With regard to the gender ideology, I think it's very important the church makes a strong statement here,\" said Bishop Robert Barron of Minnesota's Winona-Rochester diocese during the public discussion of the revised directives. The Catholic Health Association thanked the bishops for incorporating much of the organization's feedback into the directives. It said in a statement, \"Catholic providers will continue to welcome those who seek medical care from us and identify as transgender. We will continue to treat these individuals with dignity and respect, which is consistent with Catholic social teaching and our moral obligation to serve everyone, particularly those who are marginalized.\" The new guidelines incorporate earlier documents on gender identity from the Vatican in 2024 and the U.S. bishops in 2023. In the 2023 doctrinal note, titled \"Moral Limits to the Technological Manipulation of the Human Body,\" the bishops specified: \"Catholic health care services must not perform interventions, whether surgical or chemical, that aim to transform the sexual characteristics of a human body into those of the opposite sex, or take part in the development of such procedures.\" <h3>Progressive religious voices respond</h3> The Catholic Church is not monolithic when it comes to transgender rights. Some parishes and priests welcome trans Catholics into the fold, while others are not as accepting. \"Catholic teaching upholds the invaluable dignity of every human life, and for many trans people, gender-affirming care is what makes life livable,\" said Michael Sennett, a trans man who is active in his Massachusetts parish. Sennett serves on the board of New Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ inclusion in the Catholic Church. In 2024, the group arranged a meeting with Pope Francis to discuss the need for gender-affirming care. New Ways Ministry's executive director, Francis DeBernardo, said that for many transgender Catholics he knows, \"the transition process was not just a biological necessity, but a spiritual imperative. That if they were going to be living as authentic people in the way that they believe God made them, then transition becomes a necessary thing.\" On the same day that U.S. Catholic bishops were discussing gender identity, the heads of several major progressive religious denominations issued a statement in support of transgender, intersex and nonbinary people, at a time when many state legislatures and the Trump administration are curtailing their rights. The 10 signers included the heads of the Unitarian Universalist Association, the Episcopal Church, the Union for Reform Judaism and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). \"During a time when our country is placing their lives under increasingly serious threat, there is a disgraceful misconception that all people of faith do not affirm the full spectrum of gender – a great many of us do. Let it be known instead that our beloveds are created in the image of God – Holy and whole,\" the religious leaders said in a statement. <h3>U.S. bishops united in their concern for immigrants</h3> The Catholic bishops, wrapping up their conference in Baltimore, overwhelmingly approved a \"special message\" on immigration Wednesday. Such pastoral statements are rare; the last was in 2013 in response to the Obama administration's mandate for insurers to provide contraception coverage. Catholic leaders individually have criticized the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Fear of immigration enforcement has suppressed Mass attendance at some parishes. Local clerics are fighting to administer sacraments to detained immigrants. \"We are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement,\" the bishops' statement reads. \"We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants. We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care.\" In a show of unity, multiple bishops stood up to speak in favor of the statement during the final afternoon discussion, including Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul Coakley, the newly elected president of the conference. \"I'm strongly in support of it for the good of our immigrant brothers and sisters, but also to find a nice balance,\" Coakley said, noting that they call \"upon our lawmakers and our administration to offer us a meaningful path of reform of our immigration system.\" Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich walked to the microphone to recommend stronger language around mass deportation. \"That seems to be the central issue we are facing with our people at this time,\" he said. His brother bishops agreed. The updated text now states that U.S. Catholic bishops \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people.",

    "title": "Some Black police officials worry more federal agents will breed community mistrust",
    "text": "Jaiden Booth has been keeping a close eye on viral videos in cities across the country where National Guard and immigration enforcement agents have been deployed, especially how people of color are being treated during immigration raids and protests. Over the past few months, Booth, a St. Louis resident, said he has seen federal agents and unmarked vehicles in various immigrant communities around the city, which pushed him to start preparing to better support vulnerable people. He came to a recent federal enforcement safety town hall in a St. Louis gym hosted by local activists and immigration lawyers to learn more about trainings to monitor ICE activity. Booth is opposed to immigration agents or National Guard members policing communities of color, because he said it does not make them safer. Booth fears that the presence of troops and federal agents could set the stage for more negative interactions with Black Americans, including harassment or mistreatment. And this is also a concern for some Black police officials across the country. Like in most American cities, <a href=\"https://slmpd.org/stats/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>crime is down</u></a> in St. Louis. Over the past year, violent and property crimes decreased, and the city's homicide rate is the lowest it has been in years. There have been 123 murders in 2025 to date, compared to 224 in 2020, according to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Even with crime trending downward, President Trump suggested in September that St. Louis needs help addressing crime. \"We've got to save these cities,\" Trump said during a recent interview in the Oval Office. \"This isn't like, you know, we're gonna do something … We have to save St. Louis.\" On Oct. 1, Missouri's Republican governor <a href=\"https://governor.mo.gov/press-releases/archive/governor-kehoe-authorizes-missouri-national-guard-support-immigration-and\" target=\"_blank\">activated the state's National Guard</a> to help ICE agents with clerical duties. St. Louis Public Radio <a href=\"https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2025-09-30/missouri-gov-kehoe-activates-national-guard-to-assist-ice-agents\" target=\"_blank\"><u>reported</u></a> that 15 guardsmen will help ICE with tasks such as data entry, logistical support and case management. Neither the governor's office nor the state's National Guard responded to a request for an interview. The aggressive push to send troops into Democratic-led cities and their communities of color drives a wedge between police and residents, said Donny Walters, president of Ethical Society of Police, St. Louis' Black police officers union. \"This type of heavy-handed tactic is pushing us backwards instead of bringing us closer together,\" Walters said. \"What should be done from our federal government is they should be giving us resources to help our Black and brown communities [as] opposed to feeling like, 'Oh, we got to do more enforcement.'\" He is concerned that if federal agents or National Guardsmen mistreat Black St. Louisans or other communities of color, it will erode the trust Black police officers worked hard to build. \"Let's say they come in for six weeks, and whatever they are doing, however they are doing it, when they leave, we now are left with the fallout,\" he said. \"We're now left with dealing with the community after the fact.\" Some Black police officers say there are other ways to drive down crime, and that interventions should be led by city leaders and social service organizations. \"No city is without its challenges, but what we recognize is across this country, we have seen a decline in violent crime and other crimes throughout the cities, and it's due to the work that has been done by mayors, city managers and police chiefs,\" said Renee Hall, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. Hall said the aggressive tactics used by troops and federal agents resembles policing during the Jim Crow era. She said Black communities have been historically over-policed, and described this as a legacy of American slavery. \"And so now we're deploying those same kinds of tactics that resemble the 1940s and 1950s,\" Hall said. \"It just sends the wrong message in the United States, when we have done so much work in law enforcement to step away from those stereotypes … and it's performative and it doesn't get us the results that most Americans are looking for, and that is actual results of reducing crime.\"<br>",

    "title": "3 questions about Trump's 50-year mortgage plan",
    "text": "Most people who take out mortgages go with a 30-year term. But President Trump wants the federal government to back a 50-year mortgage option for homebuyers — a plan that would be \"a complete game changer,\" according to Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Backers of the idea say it could help <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/09/nx-s1-5600733/many-would-be-buyers-are-frozen-out-of-the-housing-market\" target=\"_blank\">more prospective buyers get into a home</a> they might not otherwise afford. But skepticism abounds, with Fox News' Laura Ingraham<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6384926758112\" target=\"_blank\"> telling Trump this week</a> that the proposal \"has enraged your MAGA friends.\" Ingraham cited \"significant MAGA backlash, calling it a giveaway to the banks and simply prolonging the time it would take for Americans to own a home outright.\" Trump said the criticism is overblown: \"All it means is you pay less per month, you pay it over a longer period of time. It's not like a big factor. It might help a little bit.\" The proposal is being floated at a time when many are struggling to get a foothold in the housing market. The<a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/research/october-2025-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> pace of home sales has slowed</a>, as potential buyers navigate two main obstacles: mortgage interest rates spiked in recent years, and home prices continue to rise in many areas. The new plan would also expose borrowers to debt for 20 additional years compared to a 30-year mortgage. And because standard<a href=\"https://finred.usalearning.gov/ToolsAndAddRes/Calculators/Housing\" target=\"_blank\"> repayment schedules</a> devote far more money to paying interest in the early years of a loan rather than paying down the principal, it would take home buyers even longer to build equity in their property. \"You're going to be paying almost all interest for the first 10 years. It's really akin to an interest-only loan at that point,\" says Chris Hendrix, senior vice president for the home loans unit of NBKC Bank in Kansas City. He adds, \"that's true for a 30-year loan too: for the first 10 years, you're paying mostly interest on that loan. But it would look even worse on a 50-year loan for sure.\" Many questions remain about the plan, which the Trump administration revealed over the weekend. <h3>How do the numbers look on a 50-year versus 30-year mortgage?</h3> Using a $400,000 home with a 6.25% interest rate and a 10% down payment as an example, Realtor.com senior economist Joel Berner said via email, \"a 50-year loan would save at most about $250 per month compared to the 30-year loan.\" That would help buyers in the short term — but over decades, buyers would end up paying much more. \"Total interest on the 50-year loan would amount to $816,396 compared to $438,156 on the 30-year loan, a difference of $378,240,\" he says. \"That's 86% more interest over the life of the loans.\" Berner cautions that his hypothetical example assumes the same interest rate for both loans. In reality, he says, the interest rate for a 50-year loan would be higher than one for 30 years, making the disparity even more pronounced. \"The longer the life of the loan, the more compensation the lender will demand.\" <h3>Why would a bank want to offer a 50-year mortgage, and why would a buyer want one?</h3> \"Buyers do benefit from spreading out the high cost of a home purchase over a longer period,\" Berner says, \"but lenders certainly benefit too by having a longer period to charge higher interest rates.\" Bruce Marks, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/nx-s1-5156313/vote-election-membership-neighborhood-assistance-corporation-of-america\" target=\"_blank\">the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America</a>, a nonprofit that helps people get low-cost mortgages, is skeptical that home buyers will embrace the plan. \"It will have no legs because they've tried to do a 40-year term that has not taken off,\" he says, referring to 40-year mortgage modifications that have been offered in earlier attempts to <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/23/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-additional-actions-to-prevent-foreclosures/\" target=\"_blank\">help struggling homeowners</a>. The 50-year proposal \"is even worse,\" Marks says. \"It will go nowhere. Borrowers will not do it. They see through that. They will know that they will not generate any wealth.\" The potential timing of a 50-year mortgage is uncertain. \"There's a lot of legal analysis\" over the proposal, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-briefing-kevin-hassett-the-white-house-november-10-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">said this week</a>, as he implied the plan might require legislation. Under the <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/29/2020-27571/qualified-mortgage-definition-under-the-truth-in-lending-act-regulation-z-seasoned-qm-loan\" target=\"_blank\">Dodd-Frank Act</a>, mortgages longer than 30 years don't meet the criteria for qualified mortgages — meaning they're ineligible to get the backing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and lenders would be hesitant to offer them. In response to criticisms of the plan, Hassett said homeowners also build equity when their properties appreciate in value. Noting that prices tend to increase, he added, \"I don't think that the absence of equity is a serious concern about this.\" <h3>Could other changes help ease the housing crunch?</h3> \"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner says. \"The administration would do better to reverse tariff-induced inflation, which is keeping the rates on existing mortgages high, and to encourage the<a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/research/us-housing-supply-gap-2025/\" target=\"_blank\"> expansion of housing supply</a> by promoting homebuilding.\" Hendrix says he understands the White House's motivation: to address a housing crisis. \"The median homebuyer right now in the nation is 59 years old. It is the highest that it's ever been since we started tracking it since 1981. What else is staggering is the median age for a first-time homebuyer is 40 years old right now. You're looking at a generation that has not had the ability to get into a property, start building equity, start building wealth from a home.\" Lower interest rates could help, Hendrix says. But he adds that the government also has other tools, such as helping first-time homebuyers and encouraging housing construction. One change Marks would like to see is any move that might limit individual homebuyers from being outbid by large corporations that add homes as part of their investment portfolios. Another, he says, is any policy that might support buyers secure mortgages of 30 years or less. \"The 30-year term has always been the sweet spot in this country. And that sets us apart from every other country. And we should not just try to eliminate that or undermine that. We should double down,\" he says, and find ways to give consumers more flexibility and financial well-being.",

    "title": "Tatsuya Nakadai, an icon of Japanese cinema, has died at 92",
    "text": "Tatsuya Nakadai, a veteran Japanese actor best known for films such as <em>Ran, High and Low</em> and <em>Harakiri</em>, died on Saturday at the age of 92. His collaborations with some of the greatest directors in Japan cemented him as an icon of the \"Golden Age\" of Japanese cinema. He died from pneumonia, according to a statement from <a href=\"https://www.mumeijuku.net/index_eng.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mumeijuku</a>, the acting school and theater company that Nakadai founded. Nakadai began his career as a theater actor, and remained committed to the stage throughout his life — in part because, unlike many actors at the time, he declined to sign an exclusive contract with a film studio. Doing so also gave him freedom to take on different roles — in samurai epics, realist dramas, crime thrillers, and even science fiction — and work with many different directors over the course of his career. After a brief cameo in Akira Kurosawa's 1954 movie <em>Seven Samurai</em>, the film that also happens to be the actor's most revered internationally, he played the lead in Masaki Kobayashi's trilogy <em>The Human Condition </em>(1959–1961). The series stars Nakadai as a pacifist soldier in World War II-era Japan. He credited much of his success to Kobayashi, whom he regarded as a mentor. \"While I'm greatly indebted to Kurosawa,\" he told the Criterion Channel in <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/starring-tatsuya-nakadai/season:1/videos/tatsuya-nakadai-five-masters\" target=\"_blank\">an interview translated to English</a>, \"the director who discovered me and made me into the working actor that I am today was Masaki Kobayashi.\" While filming <em>The Human Condition, </em>which took around four years to complete, Nakadai continued to work with Kurosawa. He starred alongside Toshiro Mifune, another legend of Japanese cinema, in <em>Yojimbo </em>in 1961 and <em>High and Low</em> in 1963. With <em>Harakiri</em>, Nakadai's partnership with Kobayashi came to a crescendo. The 1962 film stars Nakadai as a lone samurai asking a local lord for permission to commit harakiri, a form of ritual suicide. The actor used a stylized storytelling voice to play the character as he narrates the events that led to his downfall, evoking kabuki, a form of traditional Japanese theater. In a 2005 <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/a-golden-age\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a>, Nakadai described the film as a \"drama of dialogue,\" which allowed him to apply what he'd learned on the stage to his performance on screen. No surprise, then, that the actor, who considered theater acting his primary profession, favored <em>Harakiri </em>above all his other films. Perhaps his most famous role came in 1985 with Kurosawa's last epic, <em>Ran</em>, loosely based on <em>King Lear</em>. Although he was only in his fifties, Nakadai starred as the aging warlord Hidetora Ichimonji, donning heavy makeup in order to fully embody the character.<em> </em> The plentiful opportunities that Nakadai enjoyed as an actor came with a great deal of pressure. \"For me, my twenties were like climbing Mount Fuji with a heavy load on my back, huffing and puffing,\" he said in 2005. \"It felt like I was climbing, and the heavy load was everyone's masterpieces.\" The \"heavy load\" he bore as a significant contributor to the growth of Japanese cinema has not been overlooked in Japan. In 1996, he was awarded Japan's Medal with Purple Ribbon, honoring those with achievements in arts and academics, and in 2015, the emperor granted him the Order of Culture, the highest honor bestowed upon citizens with major achievements in the arts and sciences.",

    "title": "New malaria drug could be a life-saver as the standard drug shows signs of weakness",
    "text": "At the turn of the millennium, a new class of drugs derived from ancient Chinese herbal medicine revolutionized malaria care. Artemisinin's, as they're called, are based on extracts from the sweet wormwood plant. They arrived just as the drugs used since the 1970s were becoming useless for many, as the parasite that causes malaria evolved resistance. \"The deaths we saw in the late 1990s, the early 2000s — like 2 million a year — that was a direct result of drug failure,\" says <a href=\"https://www.mmv.org/about-us/our-team/george-jagoe\" target=\"_blank\">George Jagoe</a>, executive vice president of access and product management at Medicines for Malaria Venture, a non-profit. \"No one ever wants to be behind the 8-ball again.\" Artemisinins have saved millions of lives since then and are now the foundation of malaria treatment worldwide. But there are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/15/g-s1-34176/malaria-drug-resistance-children-artemisinin-africa\" target=\"_blank\">worrying signs</a> that these drugs are following in the footsteps of their predecessors. To prevent history from repeating itself, new drugs that target the malaria parasite differently are required, says Jagoe. \"I would call it being ready, having a fire extinguisher in the back that you're ready to use, but maybe not necessarily deploying, versus the house catches on fire and you've got nothing,\" says Jagoe. After more than two decades, researchers are on the cusp of having that fire extinguisher. A new drug, called GanLum, was more than 97% effective at treating malaria in clinical trials carried out across 12 African countries, researchers reported Wednesday at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Toronto. That's as good, if not better, than the current standard of treatment. If approved by regulators, it could be a powerful new tool against a disease that kills roughly half a million people each year. \"It's a big deal,\" says <a href=\"https://biology.nd.edu/people/kasturi-haldar/\" target=\"_blank\">Kasturi Haldar</a>, a biologist at the University of Notre Dame who has studied malaria for decades and was not involved in this study. \"It's also pretty timely.\" That's because of artemisinin resistance. First discovered in southeast Asia in the late 2000s, it's recently spread to the continent hardest hit by malaria. \"Partial artemisinin resistance has been spreading quite aggressively across many parts of Africa,\" says <a href=\"https://microbiology.columbia.edu/faculty-david-fidock\" target=\"_blank\">David Fidock</a>, a microbiologist at Columbia University who wasn't involved in the study. \"We've been sounding the alarm that we must have new drugs to deploy, should resistance lead to treatment failure. [GanLum] will help stem that significantly.\" GanLum stands for ganaplacide/lumefantrine, a combination of two drugs, one new and one old (most antimalarial treatments are combinations of drugs, to target the parasite at different stages of infection). The new one, ganaplacide, was discovered by scientists at Novartis after screening over 2.3 million molecules<strong> </strong>for antimalarial properties. It seems to work by disrupting the malaria parasites' ability to live inside human red blood cells. In the lab, the researchers showed it could kill all known forms of the parasite, including those with mutations linked to artemisinin resistance. It also attacks the stage of the parasite that's responsible for transmission. \"That is very desirable for a drug to have,\" says Haldar, since it can prevent the spread, in addition to just treating the patient. In clinical trial settings, the drug performed well too. The research team enrolled over 16,000 adults and children over 2 years old with malaria across a dozen countries in Africa. Half took GanLum over the course of three days and half got the current artemisinin-based standard of care. The team found both drugs were about equally effective, with GanLum coming out slightly on top. Both drugs had similar levels of side effects, including nausea and diarrhea. But the GanLum group did experience more vomiting. The drug still needs to clear additional regulatory hurdles before it gets to patients. The team thinks that'll take about a year and a half. Even if it's approved and rolled out, GanLum likely won't be fully replacing artemisinin-based treatments anytime soon, since arteminisin-based treatments still work in many areas. \"But at this point, it looks good enough that it could be used where there's a lack of responsiveness to the current [artemisinin-based] drugs,\" says Haldar.  Ultimately, that could prolong the lifespan of both drugs, and help countries avoid the kind of surge in deaths that's happened when resistance overwhelms existing tools.",

    "title": "Israel's president says 'shocking' settler violence against Palestinians must end",
    "text": "JERUSALEM — Israel's president and high-ranking military officials on Wednesday condemned attacks a day earlier by Jewish settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, calling for an end to a growing wave of settler violence in the occupied territory. President Isaac Herzog described the attacks as \"shocking and serious,\" adding a rare and powerful voice to what has been muted criticism by top Israeli officials of the settler violence. Herzog's position, while largely ceremonial, is meant to serve as a moral compass and unifying force for the country. Herzog said the violence committed by a \"handful\" of perpetrators \"crosses a red line,\" adding in a social media post that \"all state authorities must act decisively to eradicate the phenomenon.\" His remarks, and those of two high-ranking military officials, came after dozens of masked Israeli settlers attacked the Palestinian villages of Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf in the West Bank on Tuesday, setting fire to vehicles and other property before clashing with Israeli soldiers. In other developments Wednesday: — Israel reopened a crossing into the northern Gaza Strip that had been closed for two months. The move was welcomed by officials at the United Nations, who say Israel has been too slow in surging humanitarian aid to the territory since a ceasefire began last month. Aid has been delivered into Gaza since Oct. 10 through two crossings in southern and central Gaza. — The Israeli military said it killed four armed militants who posed an \"immediate threat\" in areas of southern Gaza under its control. In Khan Younis, one person was killed while approaching Israeli troops across the so-called yellow line. In Rafah, three people were killed while troops in the area were working to destroy underground tunnels. <h3>Military leaders react to settler violence in the West Bank</h3> The Israeli army's chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, echoed Herzog's condemnations of the West Bank violence, saying the military \"will not tolerate the phenomena of a minority of criminals who tarnish a law-abiding public.\" He said the army is committed to stopping violent acts committed by settlers, which he described as contrary to Israeli values and that \"divert the attention of our forces from fulfilling their mission.\" The chief of the military's Central Command, Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, said responding to an \"anarchist fringe\" requires the use of significant resources that could otherwise be focused on bolstering security and conducting counterterrorism operations. The army said the settlers who attacked the villages fled to a nearby industrial zone and attacked soldiers responding to the violence, damaging a military vehicle. Police said four Israelis were arrested, while the military said four Palestinians were wounded. On Wednesday, police said three of the suspects were released and that one, a minor arrested on suspicion of arson and assault, will remain in custody for six more days, as ordered by a judge. Police said the actions of the three who were released are still under investigation \"with the goal of bringing offenders to justice, regardless of their background.\" <h3>Settler violence has surged</h3> Tuesday's violence in the West Bank was the latest in a series of attacks by young settlers that have surged since the war in Gaza erupted two years ago. The attacks have intensified in recent weeks as Palestinians harvest their olive trees in an annual ritual. The U.N. humanitarian office last week reported more Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank in October than in any other month since it began keeping track in 2006. There were over 260 attacks, the office said. Palestinians and human rights workers accuse the Israeli army and police of failing to halt attacks by settlers. Israel's government is dominated by far-right proponents of the settler movement including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who formulates settlement policy, and Cabinet minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the nation's police force. Muayyad Shaaban, who heads an office in the Palestinian Authority that is tracking the violence, said the settlers set fire to four dairy trucks, farmland, tin shacks and tents belonging to a Bedouin community. He said the attacks were part of a campaign to drive Palestinians from their land and accused Israel of giving the settlers protection and immunity. He called for sanctions against groups that \"sponsor and support the colonial settlement terrorism project.\" <h3>Palestinians react angrily</h3> In Beit Lid, residents said they don't want their lives ruled by fear of settler violence. Mahmoud Edeis said the violence is undermining his family's right to live in safety. \"To feel that my children are safe, that when I go to sleep I can say, 'Okay, there's nothing (to worry about),'\" he said. \"But at any moment something could happen … This can't go on. It can't be that we keep living our whole lives in a state of fear and danger.\" Amjad Amer Al-Juneidi, who works at a dairy factory that was attacked Tuesday, said the \"fully organized\" attack saw one person carrying gasoline-filled cans, another prying open the factory door with a crowbar and a third individual igniting the fuel. \"Their entry into the company wasn't random. It was organized, and they had a fully organized tactic for how to carry out the burning,\" Al-Juneidi said. <h3>UN officials say more aid is needed in Gaza</h3> While U.N. officials welcomed the Israeli decision to reopen the Zikim crossing into northern Gaza, they also reiterated criticism of Israel for not doing more. Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesperson, said Wednesday that humanitarian groups in Gaza are being hampered in their ability to distribute food once it arrives in the territory and having to \"stretch out the available stocks.\" The demand for baby formula, for example, far exceeds the current supply, UNICEF spokesperson Ricardo Pires told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Pires said there are also concerns about whether there will be enough syringes to carry out a vaccination campaign that began this month and will continue into January. He said there could be supply problems starting next month if Israel doesn't allow greater shipments into Gaza. The Israeli agency in charge of humanitarian aid in Gaza, COGAT, said in a statement on Tuesday that \"Israel is fully committed to its obligation to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid trucks in accordance with the (ceasefire) agreement.",

    "text": "Chess's international governing body said Tuesday that it filed a complaint against former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik after he leveled unproven allegations of cheating against fellow players, including Daniel Naroditsky, who died last month at age 29. The complaint centers on harassment and \"the insulting of an individual's dignity,\" said the International Chess Federation, known by the acronym FIDE, in a news release. Naroditsky's cause of death has not been made public. Kramnik accused Naroditsky, an American grandmaster of cheating last year and continued to share suspicions on social media. Naroditsky, a prodigious chess player who helped usher in the game's online boom with educational YouTube videos and livestreams, denied the allegations. In his last livestream before his death, Naroditsky said that Kramnik's allegations had taken a toll on him. \"Ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it,\" Naroditsky said. Other chess grandmasters, including Hikaru Nakamura and Nihal Sarin, have called out Kramnik's conduct, saying the Russian player had harassed Naroditsky. Kramnik did not immediately respond to requests for comment submitted through his GoFundMe page for his campaign against cheating, but he previously called the federation's investigation \"insulting and unfair.\" The complaint, submitted to the FIDE Ethics & Disciplinary Commission, describes a \"pattern of conduct over roughly two years\" related to possible harassment, read the federation's statement. It includes testimony provided by Czech grandmaster David Navara, whom Kramnik also accused of cheating, and \"people close to Daniel Naroditsky.\" The federation may sanction a player who makes unfounded accusations based on emotion or insufficient data, according to its anti-cheating laws. It also requires substantial evidence to launch a cheating investigation. There were no documented reports of the federation investigating Naroditsky. The governing body previously said it had referred Kramnik's statements, before and after Naroditsky's death, to the ethics commission. Tuesday's announcement is the formal submission of a complaint.",

    "title": "'It's a very unique job:' Meet the Scottish dam keeper watching over Arizona reservoir",
    "text": "On any given day a torrent of water gushes from the base of the Bartlett Dam in Central Arizona — enough to fill a backyard swimming pool within seconds. Don McMillan oversees it all as a dam keeper for the Salt River Project, a utility that runs the dam along the Verde River and provides water to more than 2.5 million people. &#8220; A lot of people ask me what I do here. The simple answer is, my job is to make sure this big piece of concrete doesn&#8217;t go anywhere,” McMillan said, referring to the entire dam. “Every day I walk through this dam, I walk through the top of the dam, I walk through the bottom of the dam, I put my eyes on the structure. I&#8217;m just looking for any changes, any variance from the day before, the week before.” Western rivers, reservoirs and dams like the Bartlett Dam provide water to tens of millions of people living in the Western United States, but climate change and overuse are putting stress on those systems. One example is the dwindling water supply on the Colorado River. The seven states that rely on it for water <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/11/12/colorado-river-cutbacks\">missed a Tuesday deadline</a> to come up with a plan to share the water in times of drought. The federal government may have to step in now, forcing the states to cut back on water use. The Bartlett Dam is a vital link in a chain of water infrastructure. But rising summer temperatures, growing cities that require more water and a two-decade-long megadrought have put stress on that water system. “We live in the desert,” McMillan said. “We only have a few lakes in all of Arizona.” And supplying water to those who need it is crucial, McMillan said, but so is keeping the river healthy, and the dam helps do that. “We have to supply paying customers downstream. But we also want to keep this river alive,” McMillan said. “We want to save the flora, the fauna, the trees and the fish. Without this being here, the river would die.” Construction on the Bartlett Dam finished in 1939, and the dam has accumulated nearly a century of mud and debris piled behind it. A federal process is underway to figure out the best way to fix the problem, and the Salt River Project <a href=\"https://www.srpnet.com/grid-water-management/water-management/lakes/bartlett-dam-project\">wants to build an entirely new dam</a>. “All those cities down there, they continue to grow,” McMillan said, “but our lake holds less water because of the sediment.” The lake is currently only half full. McMillan said this is the driest season he’s experienced since taking the job eight years ago. “We are in the hands of the gods when it comes to the lakes and the rain,” McMillan said. “We really, really hope we get a really high snowfall in the mountains, because that&#8217;s where most of our water comes from in the springtime.” McMillan lives in a company house next to the dam. His proximity is important — he can be at the dam within seconds in an emergency. He cites trespassers and turbine failures that kill all the dam’s power as potential issues he’d have to deal with. He said a series of spill gates is the most critical part of the water system. Every month, he verifies that the gates are still working.  If the reservoir ever gets too full, the gates stop it from overflowing. When McMillan first moved to Arizona from Scotland, he said it was an adjustment from the “wet country” he was used to. “The first couple of summers, it was a bit of a shock to me to see how much harder it was to manage these lakes and keep the water in them,” he said. But he said he likes the life he’s carved out in the peaceful desert. He said it’s quiet where he lives, and he doesn’t have to deal with the traffic and congestion of more populated places. Plus, he can see the stars clearly at night. “My companions are the desert critters,” McMillan said. “I feel blessed to be able to do this.” ____ <em><a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/peter-odowd\">Peter O&#8217;Dowd</a> produced and edited this interview for broadcast with <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/catherine-welch\">Catherine Welch</a>. <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/staff/grace-griffin\">Grace Griffin</a> produced it for the web.</em> This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/11/12/dam-keeper-arizona-reservoir\">WBUR.org.</a><img src=\"https://pixel.wbur.org/1053497\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;\" />",

    "title": "Hearty stew for the soul: Warm up with these 3 recipes you can make all winter long",
    "text": "<em>Cooking Thanksgiving dinner can be quite an undertaking. Have questions before you get started? Kathy Gunst can help. <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/11/12/thanksgiving-dinner-questions\">Send her a note here</a>, and she may answer you on air. </em> Is a stew simply a thick soup? Is soup just a thinner stew? Are the terms synonymous? A stew is not a soup, and soup is not a stew. In general, a stew is heartier, thicker, and more of a comfort food that sticks to the ribs. And soup — while deeply comforting — can be a first course or a lunch, while a stew is its own main attraction. Don’t get me wrong: I am a <em>major lover </em>of soups of all kinds. I even <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Soup-Swap-Comforting-Recipes-Share/dp/1452148368\">wrote a book</a> about it. As the days get shorter and darker and decidedly colder, I decided to experiment with stews and see how they hold up compared to making a pot of soup. The results were deeply satisfying; these three stews are recipes I plan on making again and again throughout the winter season. Semantics aside, let&#8217;s talk about stews. They can be made from meat, fish, poultry and/or vegetables. They can be made with onions and leeks and garlic, lots of herbs and spices, and the base can be a stock or water. What stews have in common is that they fill you up and give that warm, cozy feeling that one begins to crave this time of year. The first stew borrows flavors from Indian cuisine and is a vegetarian dish. A seemingly simple mixture of onions, garlic, fresh ginger and spices — turmeric, cinnamon, cumin and fennel seeds — is simmered with tomato paste. A combination of late fall vegetables is added — winter squash, potatoes and chick peas — and simmered with water. The entire stew happens in about an hour and the flavor is so deep and satisfying you’ll wonder how it happened. The mixture of Indian-inspired spices mixed with the heartiness of fall vegetables makes magic happen in this stew. Serve with Indian-style bread like naan, basmati rice, chopped scallions and cilantro, and dinner is ready. Next up is a fish stew made with any combination of local fish you have access to. Being in New England, I used a combination of what&#8217;s called &#8220;chowder fish,” which is generally chunks of haddock, hake, cod or other local flaky white fish, and a few shrimp. I add the shrimp shells to the sauce to infuse it with even more flavor. Leeks or onions are sauteed with chopped fennel, and sweet pepper and crushed tomatoes are added with a pinch of fresh thyme and earthy saffron. The fish goes in, and the stew simmers up in no time at all. Again, rich, complex flavors that defy the quickness of the preparation. Add warm crusty bread and a green salad, and you’ve got a feast. And finally, a pork stew with salsa verde, chiles, cinnamon, and oregano that simmers until the pork is fork-tender. Serve with warm tortillas, sour cream or crema, steamed rice, and you will feel the warmth. The vegetable and pork stews can be made a day ahead of time (the fish stew doesn’t really benefit from being made ahead of time) and the flavors will deepen. It also means that you will arrive home from a busy day and have a comforting, filling dinner ready in no time. <h3>Indian-spiced late fall vegetable stew</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1053411\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1053411\" style=\"width: 3000px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1053411\" src=\"https://media.wbur.org/wp/2025/11/IMG_8312-1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Indian-spiced late fall vegetable stew.

    "title": "Ken Burns' 'American Revolution' will make you think differently about U.S. history",
    "text": "Documentary producer and director <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/20/nx-s1-5580245/ken-burns-american-revolution-series-includes-voices-the-founders-overlooked\" target=\"_blank\">Ken Burns</a> came to prominence 35 years ago with <em>The Civil War,</em> a massively popular multi-part nonfiction series on PBS.<em> </em>His latest effort is a six-part series called <em>The American Revolution.</em> By focusing on the Revolutionary War<em>,</em> Burns is revisiting some very familiar territory. His long and impressive filmography includes a history of Congress, and biographies of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. He's done deep dives into American military conflicts, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/09/15/1123134723/ken-burns-the-u-s-and-the-holocaust-review-history-wwii\" target=\"_blank\">World War II</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/09/21/552575164/in-vietnam-war-ken-burns-wrestles-with-the-conflict-s-contradictions\" target=\"_blank\">Vietnam War</a>. Throughout his career, Burns has developed and perfected the tricks of his particular trade: the evocative use of music and quotations from speeches and correspondence; the use of actors to read the words of historical participants; the zooming in and out to reveal key details in period photos; and the painstaking attention to sound effects, from birds to bullets, to help bring those images to life. All of that knowledge, and all of those gimmicks, are utilized in <em>The American Revolution</em>, an exceptional work about the founding of our country. It's written by Geoffrey C. Ward, who wrote <em>The Civil War</em> and many other Burns documentaries, including the ones on Congress and Thomas Jefferson. And it's co-directed by Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt, both of whom have worked with Burns for years. But <em>The American Revolution</em> presents a challenge that even <em>The Civil War</em> did not. No photographs, period. To compensate, Burns and company use war re-enactors and place them in the actual historical locations.  On many — let's say most — documentaries using a similar technique, the effect can be cheesy. But in <em>The American Revolution,</em> the directors avoid showing the faces of the actors re-enacting battle movements. Instead, parts of their bodies are shown in intense close-up: a bandaged hand here, a muddy boot there. Elsewhere, in an approach that borders on pure art, the directors use drones to capture the action from high, high above. It's unusual — and beautiful. Battles are the surprisingly dominant ingredient of this series. <em>The American Revolution</em> goes into more detail about individual battles than I ever learned in my own American history classes — but new and vintage maps, animated to show troop positions and movements, make it all very clear, and very vibrant. The actors quoting from the historical participants, and the historians interviewed to comment on the action, do the rest. Peter Coyote, the actor who has narrated many Burns documentaries, does so again here. He's got a great voice for it, and leans into all the difficult place names, and people's names, with confident authority.  In their various war documentaries, Burns and his team always have focused as much on the ground troops as on the generals — often much more so, telling their story from the bottom up, rather than the top down. <em>The American Revolution</em> does both: We hear important observations from George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, but also from Native Americans, revolutionary women, enslaved people and others not always given voice in such narratives.  In addition, the program's historians make us think differently about the history we're witnessing. In the colonies, those who were faithful to the crown were called Loyalists, and those against them called themselves Patriots. This series humanizes both sides, and also explains why some Native tribes, including the Shawnees, sided with the British in hopes of protecting their own lands.  The sheer number of the battles, and the details about them, attest to how hard our ancestors fought for the notion of a Federalist society. At the end, <em>The American Revolution</em> reminds us that the quest to maintain that society, and to strive to achieve a more perfect union, is far from over. <br>",

Every time you shop online and make it to the checkout screen, you see those colorful pastel buttons at the bottom. Affirm. Klarna. Afterpay. Asking: Do you want to split your payment into interest-free installments? No credit check needed. Get what you want, right now.  That temptation got shoppers like Amelia Schmarzo into some money trouble. Back in 2022, she maxed out her credit card after a month of buying now and paying later. She's not alone. Buy now, pay later is everywhere now. And you can finance almost anything with it. Your clothes, your furniture … even your lips.  But if these companies don't charge interest, how do they make money? In short, people buy more stuff using these services and so sellers are willing to pay up. Which makes buy now, pay later, something of a threat to credit card companies. Cue the tussle for your impulse-buying clicks.  Today on the show, we find out how the companies work, who's most likely to use these services and who's getting a good deal.

    "text": "<em>Far-Flung Postcards is a weekly series in which NPR's international team shares moments from their lives and work around the world.</em> Growing up in Canada, I always considered the Arctic part of my backyard, a part of the country's identity and history. So I was overjoyed several years ago when I got what I considered a dream assignment: a week-long <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/139556207\" target=\"_blank\">voyage through the fabled Northwest Passage</a>, a series of waterways high above the Arctic Circle. I was aboard the CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent, a hulking Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker affectionately known by the crew as simply the<em> </em>Louis. Ahead of that excursion, I had been doing month-long reporting rotations into Afghanistan and Pakistan, and was feeling ground down. All that evaporated once I was aboard the Louis. I felt my soul replenish with joy as I breathed in the frigid, clean air and gazed out at the endless expanse of ice — there were no buildings or boats, nor any hint of humankind for hundreds of miles in any direction. The ice twinkled with the light of the sun, which shone 24 hours a day at that time of year.   My entertainment was the polar bears like this one that every day lumbered up to the side of <em>Louis</em>, cocking their heads as if curious about who these interlopers were.  It was breathtaking to be where so few people on Earth have traveled, to feel the thick ice crack under the ship, to watch the polar bears approach the ship, all the while knowing this swiftly changing hinterland would never be the same. I think often of that magical time when I read about massive cruise ships or oil tankers now regularly making their way through the Arctic. It breaks my heart thinking about the impact on the pristine region. It's selfish, but I'll always treasure the time I had to myself at the top of the world — and the majestic creatures that call it home.   <strong>See more photos from around the world:</strong><br> <ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\"><li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/g-s1-95193/jacaranda-trees-south-africa-johannesburg\" target=\"_blank\">Greetings from Johannesburg, South Africa, where spring bursts with jacaranda blooms</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/29/g-s1-95196/colombia-andes-carne-a-la-llanera-mongui\" target=\"_blank\">Greetings from high up in Colombia's Andes, where 'prairie-style meat' is a delicacy</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/22/g-s1-94347/india-train-mumbai-goa\" target=\"_blank\">Greetings from an Indian Railways coach, with spectacular views from Mumbai to Goa</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/15/g-s1-93068/switzerland-rhone-glacier-melt-alps\" target=\"_blank\">Greetings from the Rhône Glacier, where a gash of pink highlights how it's melting</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/08/nx-s1-5563880/dolphins-mediterranean-migrant-rescue-ship\" target=\"_blank\">Greetings from the Mediterranean, where dolphins swim alongside a migrant rescue ship</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5554518/video-ukraine-zelenskyy-maidan-postcard\" target=\"_blank\">Greetings from Kyiv, where you might stumble across Zelenskyy taking a stroll</a></li></ul>",

    "text": "As a kid growing up in Las Vegas, Cleto Escobedo and his best friend delighted in playing pranks together. \"We kind of had the same sense of humor,\" he recalled in a 2022 <a href=\"https://swco-ir.tdl.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/83ec5f1e-7ed8-493d-bbd5-b5b0e6627cd9/content\" target=\"_blank\">oral history interview with Texas Tech University</a>. \"We'd mess with people on the Strip, and if it'd rain, maybe we'd go splash people with puddles in my car when I was a teenager.\" And they watched a lot of comedy. \"We were big David Letterman fans when we were kids,\" he said. Just like their idol, his friend, Jimmy Kimmel, grew up to host a late-night TV show. And Kimmel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xlVAr6JZ9A\" target=\"_blank\">delivered a heartfelt monologue</a> Tuesday night paying tribute to Escobedo. \"Late last night, early this morning, we lost someone very special, who was much too young to go,\" Kimmel said, near tears. He did not disclose the cause of Escobedo's death, but thanked doctors and nurses at UCLA Medical Center for taking care of his friend. \"Cleto was a phenomenal saxophone player from a very young age,\" Kimmel said. \"He was a child prodigy. He would get standing ovations in junior high school, if you can imagine that.\" Escobedo grew up in a musical household. His father worked for years as a professional musician, and the younger Escobedo first started studying saxophone in sixth grade, because his father already had an instrument at home. He enrolled at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, played in bar bands — \"anything from country to Phil Collins,\" he said in the oral history — and in 1990, successfully auditioned to tour with superstar Paula Abdul. \"Through her, I got a record deal with Virgin Records,\" he said. \"It was kind of a Latin-y, pop, R&B record. It was kind of like the Latin Explosion record a little too early. I did some stuff in Spanglish, but it was more like a pop, funk-y kind of stuff.\" Although the album did not lead to a solo career, Escobedo worked steadily, performing with musicians such as Luis Miguel and Marc Anthony. Kimmel hired Escobedo's band, Cleto and the Cletones, to back him up when ABC launched <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> in 2003. The band included Escobedo's father, and the two, Kimmel said, were particularly proud to be what they believed to be the only father-son team performing together on late night television. \"Everyone loves Cleto,\" Kimmel said in his monologue. \"Everyone here in this show is devastated by this. It's just not fair. He was the nicest, most humble, kind and always funny person.\" Kimmel expressed sympathy for Escobedo's surviving family members, including his parents, wife and two children. He signed off with the words: \"Cherish your friends.",

A <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms#:~:text=Storms%20can%20cause:%20*%20Intense%20currents%20in,weather%20that%20can%20disrupt%20systems%20on%20Earth.\" target=\"_blank\">geomagnetic storm</a> happens when charged particles from the sun's atmosphere interact with the Earth's magnetic field. In addition to creating <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/auroras/\" target=\"_blank\">dazzling displays of color</a>, such storms can <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-hazards-magnetic-storms\" target=\"_blank\">disrupt technology</a> on Earth, from satellites and GPS to radio communications and the power grid. The activity was the result of a phenomenon called <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections\" target=\"_blank\">coronal mass ejections</a> (CMEs), massive blasts of plasma and magnetic field from the sun's outer atmosphere that grow in size as they hurtle towards Earth. Two CMEs arrived on Earth on Tuesday, Dahl said. The resulting storm <a href=\"https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1988421139991847368?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">reached G4 levels</a>, the second-highest on NOAA's five-step scale, and created a magnetic field that was \"not only eight times stronger than what's normal but … also favorable for continued activity,\" Dahl said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1988532096650883219?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">later update</a>. \"That was the most energetic and strongest of this activity out there in space,\" Dahl said. \"It was traveling significantly faster than these other two, and we think that's going to pack even a stronger punch than what we've already experienced.\" The <a href=\"https://www.spaceweather.gov/news/g4-severe-watch-effect-12-november\" target=\"_blank\">Space Weather Prediction Center says</a> the aurora may become visible \"over much of the northern half of the country, and maybe as far south as Alabama to northern California.\" The <a href=\"https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/specialist-forecasts/space-weather\" target=\"_blank\">Met Office</a>, the U.K.'s national weather service, said the aurora may also be visible over parts of Britain on Wednesday night, though it is likely to be obscured by cloud cover — as was the <a href=\"https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/michigan-northern-lights-clouds-november-11-21166749.php\" target=\"_blank\">case in Michigan</a> on Tuesday. Luckily, Americans in northern states won't have to wait long for another chance to get a glimpse. <h3><strong>How to see (and photograph!) the northern lights </strong></h3> A dark setting is essential to see the aurora, so it's important to get away from light pollution if you want a good glimpse of the northern lights. It'll be easiest to see between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time, according to NOAA. It is difficult to predict the exact timing and location of the northern lights, but you can sign up for different services that alert you when an aurora may be visible in your area. For example, a citizen science platform called <a href=\"https://aurorasaurus.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Aurorasaurus</u></a> allows users to report when and where they see an aurora, and gives estimates on how visible an aurora is in a given area. Another option is an app called My Aurora Forecast & Alerts, available for download on both iOS and Android devices. This is a location-based app that gives viewing probability and forecasts. Smartphone cameras are better at capturing the full array of an aurora than our naked eye, so be sure to go out with your phone to view a fuller spectrum of colors. If your phone camera has a night mode option, it's best to switch it on when photographing the northern lights. You can also switch your phone camera to manual mode and adjust the exposure settings to get the perfect picture. <h3><strong>Why we are seeing more northern lights </strong></h3> Auroras have been happening more frequently in the United States for a while, and will continue to do so for several months. This influx of shimmering colors comes because the sun is reaching the peak of its 11-year cycle and, therefore, its solar maximum. The solar maximum causes solar eruptions, and this increase of activity brings ions, or electrically charged particles, closer to Earth. This stream of particles is known as the solar wind. As solar winds get closer to Earth, the charged particles collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere. When they collide, light is emitted. The light emits at various wavelengths, creating a colorful display throughout the night sky. When the sun is at its solar maximum, the number of solar eruptions increases, which is why there are more auroras in the sky. Usually, this activity only takes place near the Arctic Circle, but since solar activity is strong right now, viewing areas have expanded to other regions, like the Midwest.",

    "title": "Immigrants with obesity, diabetes and other health problems may be denied visas",
    "text": "Foreigners seeking visas to live in the U.S. might be rejected if they have certain medical conditions, including diabetes or obesity, under a directive issued last week by the Trump administration. The guidance, issued in a cable the State Department sent to embassy and consular officials and examined by KFF Health News, directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the U.S. for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits. The guidance says that such people could become a \"public charge\" — a potential drain on U.S. resources — because of their health issues or age. While assessing the health of potential immigrants has been part of the visa application process for years, including screening for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and obtaining vaccine history, experts said the new guidelines greatly expand the list of medical conditions to be considered and give visa officers more power to make decisions about immigration based on an applicant's health status. The directive is part of the Trump administration's divisive and aggressive campaign to deport immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. and dissuade others from immigrating into the country. The White House's crusade to push out immigrants has included<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5570113/chicago-south-shore-building-residents-recount-humiliating-ice-raid\" target=\"_blank\"> daily mass arrests,</a><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-travel-ban-refugees-lawsuit-44ff62623ac10ef287710f0ebcf5904b\" target=\"_blank\"> bans on refugees</a> from certain countries, and plans to<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/refugees-admissions-cap-immigration-trump-administration-197a8ef1c9c219ce6167da4aba3f5a6e\" target=\"_blank\"> severely restrict the total number</a> permitted into the U.S. The new guidelines mandate that immigrants' health be a focus in the application process. The guidance applies to nearly all visa applicants but is likely to be used only in cases in which people seek to permanently reside in the U.S., said<a href=\"https://www.pli.edu/faculty/charles-wheeler-i1922367\" target=\"_blank\"> Charles Wheeler</a>, a senior attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit legal aid group. \"You must consider an applicant's health,\" the cable reads. \"Certain medical conditions – including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions – can require hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care.\" About<a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/diabetes#tab=tab_1\" target=\"_blank\"> 10% of the world's population</a> has diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are also common; they are the globe's<a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1\" target=\"_blank\"> leading killer</a>. The cable also encourages visa officers to consider other conditions, such as obesity, which it notes can cause asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure, in their assessment of whether an immigrant could become a public charge and therefore should be denied entry into the U.S. \"All of these can require expensive, long-term care,\" the cable reads. Spokespeople for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable. Visa officers were also directed to determine if applicants have the means to pay for medical treatment without help from the U.S. government. \"Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?\" the cable reads. The cable's language appears at odds with the Foreign Affairs Manual, the State Department's own handbook, which says that visa officers cannot reject an application based on \"what if\" scenarios, Wheeler said. The guidance directs visa officers to develop \"their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future,\" he said. \"That's troubling because they're not medically trained, they have no experience in this area, and they shouldn't be making projections based on their own personal knowledge or bias.\" The guidance also directs visa officers to consider the health of family members, including children or older parents. \"Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?\" the cable asks. Immigrants already undergo a medical exam by a physician who's been approved by a U.S. embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, and asked to<a href=\"https://uk.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/204/2023/03/USA-MEDICAL-QUESTIONNAIRE_IV.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> fill out a form</a> that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence. They're also required to have a number of vaccinations to guard against<a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/tools/designated-civil-surgeons/vaccination-requirements\" target=\"_blank\"> infectious diseases</a> like measles, polio, and hepatitis B. But the new guidance goes further, emphasizing that chronic diseases should be considered, said Sophia Genovese, an immigration lawyer at Georgetown University. She also noted that the language of the directive encourages visa officers and the doctors who examine people seeking to immigrate to speculate on the cost of applicants' medical care and their ability to get employment in the U.S., considering their medical history. \"Taking into consideration one's diabetic history or heart health history — that's quite expansive,\" Genovese said. \"There is a degree of this assessment already, just not quite as expansive as opining over, 'What if someone goes into diabetic shock?' If this change is going to happen immediately, that's obviously going to cause a myriad of issues when people are going into their consular interviews.\" <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us\" target=\"_blank\"><em>KFF Health News</em></a><em> is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at</em><a href=\"https://www.kff.org/about-us\" target=\"_blank\"><em> KFF</em></a><em>.</em>",
